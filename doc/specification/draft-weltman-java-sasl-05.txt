Abstract 
    
   This document defines a client-side and a server-side Java language 
   interface for using the Simple Authentication and Security Layer 
   (SASL) mechanisms for adding authentication support to connection- 
   based protocols. The interface promotes sharing of SASL Mechanism 
   Drivers and security layers between applications using different 
   protocols. It complements but does not replace [SASL], which defines 
   and exemplifies use of the SASL protocol in a language-independent 
   way.

1. Introduction 
    
   See [SASL], section 3, for an introduction to and overview of the 
   SASL framework for authentication and negotiation of a security 
   layer. The following presents an outline of the concepts.

   An application chooses a Protocol Driver specific to the protocol it 
   wants to use, and specifies one or more acceptable mechanisms. The 
   Protocol Driver controls the socket, and knows the format/packaging 
   of bytes sent down and received from the socket, but does not know 
   how to authenticate or to encrypt/ decrypt the bytes. It uses one of 
   the Mechanism Drivers to help it perform authentication. The Protocol 
   Driver examines each byte string received from the server during the 
   authentication in a protocol-specific way to determine if the 
   authentication process has been completed. If not, the byte string is 
   passed to the Mechanism Driver to be interpreted as a server 
   challenge; the Mechanism Driver returns an appropriate response, 
   which the Protocol Driver can encode in a protocol-specific way and 
   return to the server. 
    
   If the Protocol Driver concludes from the byte string received from 
   the server that authentication is complete, it may query the 
   Mechanism Driver if it considers the authentication process complete, 
   in order to thwart early completion messages inserted by an intruder. 
    
   On completed authentication, the Protocol Driver may use the 
   Mechanism Driver to encode and decode any data exchanged through the 
   socket if a security layer was negotiated. 
    
   A complication here is that some authentication methods may require 
   additional user/application input.  That means that a Mechanism 
   Driver may need to call up to an application during the 
   authentication process. To satisfy this requirement, the application 
   can supply a javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler instance

   [JAAS] that can be used by the Mechanism Driver to prompt the user 
   for additional input. 
    
   Protocol Drivers are protocol-dependent and may be built in to a 
   protocol package or an application. There is a generalized framework 
   for registering and finding Mechanism Drivers. The framework uses a 
   factory to produce an appropriate Mechanism Driver. The factory may 
   be preconfigured, explicitly specified by the caller, specified as a 
   list of packages by the caller, or be identified based on a list of 
   packages in the System properties.  
    
   The Mechanism Drivers are protocol-independent, and don't deal 
   directly with network connections, just byte arrays, so they can be 
   implemented in a generalizable way for all protocols. 
    
   The negotiated security layer is implemented by encoding and decoding 
   routines in the Mechanism Driver, using parameters and resolutions 
   reached during authentication. 
    
   Different Mechanism Drivers may require different parameters to carry 
   out the authentication process. This is handled by passing a 
   java.util.Hashtable object as an argument to instantiation methods. 
    
   In the following discussion, 'client' refers to the client-side 
   Protocol Driver that is using the SASL mechanism while 'server' 
   refers to the server-side Protocol Driver that is using the SASL 
   mechanism.

   In the Java SASL environment, the SaslClient interface represents the 
   client's view of the Mechanism Driver, while the SaslServer interface 
   represents the server's view.

   A client using the Java SASL API may communicate with any server 
   implementing the SASL protocol, and a server may use the API to 
   process authentication requests from any client using the SASL 
   protocol. It is not required that both sides use the same language 
   bindings. 
    
    
2. Overview of the SASL classes 
 

2.1 Interfaces 
    
   SaslClient                  Performs SASL authentication as a 
                               client. 
    
   SaslClientFactory           An interface for creating instances of 
                               SaslClient. It is not normally accessed 
                               directly by a client, which will use the 
                               Sasl static methods instead. However, a 
                               particular environment may provide and

                               install a new or different 
                               SaslClientFactory. 
    
   SaslServer                  Performs SASL authentication as a 
                               server. 
    
   SaslServerFactory           An interface for creating instances of 
                               SaslServer. It is not normally accessed 
                               directly by a server, which will use the 
                               Sasl static methods instead. However, a 
                               particular environment may provide and

                               SaslServerFactory. 
    

2.2 Classes 
    
    
   Sasl                        A static class for creating SASL clients 
                               and servers. It transparently locates 
                               and uses any available 
                               SaslClientFactory/SaslServerFactory 
                               instances. 
    
   AuthorizeCallback           This callback is used by SaslServer to 
                              determine whether one entity (identified 
                              by an authenticated authentication id) 
                              can act on behalf of another entity 
                              (identified by an authorization id). 
    
   RealmCallback              This callback is used by SaslClient and 
                              SaslServer to retrieve realm information. 
    
   RealmChoiceCallback        This callback is used by SaslClient and 
                              SaslServer to obtain one or more realms 
                              given a list of realm choices. 
    
   SaslException               Exception thrown on errors and failures 
                               in the authentication process. 
    
    
3. Overview of SASL API Use 
    
   An application generally uses the SASL API as follows: 
    
   -    Create an object implementing the client authentication 
        callback interfaces, which can provide credentials when 
        required by the SaslClient. 
    
   -    Pass a list of acceptable or known Mechanisms and a callback 
        handler to Sasl.createSaslClient. The method returns an object 
        implementing SaslClient on success.

JAVA SASL API                                                May, 2001 
 
 
    
    
   -    Have the SaslClient object begin the authentication process by 
        providing an initial server response, if the protocol supports 
        an initial response. 
    
   -    Responses/challenges are exchanged with the server. If a 
        response indicates authentication has completed, SaslClient is 
        queried for validation, and methods for encoding and decoding 
        data according to the negotiated security layer may be invoked 
        on it. If not, the SaslClient is queried for an appropriate 
        next response to the server. This continues until 
        authentication has completed. 
    
   -    If a security layer has been negotiated, for the rest of the 
        session, messages to the server are first encoded by using 
        SaslClient before being written, and messages from the server 
        are first decoded by using SaslClient before being processed in 
        the application. 
    
    
   A server generally uses the SASL API as follows: 
    
   -    It receives a request from the client requesting authentication 
        for a particular SASL mechanism, accompanied by an optional 
        initial response. 
    
   -    It processes the initial response and generates a challenge 
        specific to the SASL mechanism to be sent back to the client if 
        the response is processed successfully. If the response is 
        not processed successfully, it sends an error to the client and 
        terminates the authentication session. 
    
   -    Responses/challenges are exchanged with the client. If the 
        server cannot successfully process a response, the server sends 
        an error to the client and terminates the authentication. If 
        the server has completed the authentication and has no more 
        challenges to send, it sends a success indication to the 
        client. 
    
   -    If the authentication has completed successfully, the server 
        extracts the authorization ID of the client from the SaslServer 
        instance (if appropriate) to be used for subsequent access 
        control checks. 
    
   -    For the rest of the session, messages to and from the client are 
        encoded and decoded by using SaslServer to implement the 
        negotiated security layer (if any).

4. The Java SASL classes 
 

4.1 public class Sasl 
    
A class capable of providing a SaslClient or SaslServer. 
    

4.1.1 createSaslClient 
    
   public static SaslClient 
   createSaslClient(String[] mechanisms, 
                    String authorizationID, 
                    String protocol, 
                    String serverName, 
                    Hashtable props, 
                    javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler cbh) 
                    throws SaslException 
    
   Creates a SaslClient using the parameters supplied. It returns null 
   if no SaslClient can be created using the parameters supplied. Throws 
   SaslException if it cannot create a SaslClient because of an error. 
    
   The algorithm for selection is as follows: 
    
   1. If a factory has been installed via setSaslClientFactory(), 
      invoke createSaslClient() on it. If the method invocation returns 
      a non-null SaslClient instance, return the SaslClient instance; 
      otherwise continue. 
   2. Create a list of fully qualified class names using the package 
      names listed in the CLIENT_PKGS 
      ("javax.security.sasl.client.pkgs") property in props and the 
      class name ClientFactory. Each class name in this list identifies 
      a SaslClientFactory implementation. Starting with the first class 
      on the list, create an instance of SaslClientFactory using the 
      class' public no-argument constructor and invoke 
      createSaslClient() on it. If the method invocation returns a non-
      null SaslClient instance, return it; otherwise repeat using the 
      next class on the list until a non-null SaslClient is produced or 
      the list is exhausted. 
   3. Repeat the previous step using the CLIENT_PKGS 
      ("javax.security.sasl.client.pkgs") System property instead of 
      the property in props. 
   4. As per the Java 2 Standard Edition version 1.3 service provider 
      guidelines, check for the existence of one of more files named 
      META-INF/services/javax.security.sasl.SaslClientFactory in the 
      classpath and installed JAR files. Each file lists the fully 
      qualified class names of the factories (i.e. implementations of 
      SaslClientFactory) found in the JAR files or classpath. Construct 
      a merged list of class names using these files and repeat Step 2 
      using this list. If there are more than one of these files, the

      order in which they are processed is undefined. If no non-null 
      SaslClient instance is produced, return null. 
    
   Parameters are: 
    
      mechanisms     The non-null list of mechanism names to try. Each 
                      is the IANA-registered name of a SASL mechanism 
                      (e.g. "GSSAPI", "CRAM-MD5"). 
       
      authorizationID  The possibly null protocol-dependent 
                      identification to be used for authorization. If 
                      null or empty, the server derives an 
                      authorization ID from the client's authentication 
                      credentials. When the SASL authentication 
                      completes successfully, the specified entity is 
                      granted access. 
       
      protocol       The non-null string name of the protocol for 
                      which the authentication is being performed, e.g 
                      "pop", "ldap". 
       
      serverName     The non-null fully qualified host name of the 
                      server to authenticate to. 
    
      props          The possibly null set of properties used to 
                      select the SASL mechanism and to configure the 
                      authentication exchange of the selected 
                      mechanism. For example, if props includes the 
                      Sasl.POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT property with the value 
                      "true", then the selected SASL mechanism must not 
                      be susceptible to simple plain passive attacks. 
       
                     In addition to the standard properties of this 
                      class, other, possibly mechanism-specific, 
                      properties can be included. 
                      Properties not relevant to the selected mechanism 
                      are ignored. 
                      See Standard Properties for a list of standard 
                      properties. 
       
      cbh            The possibly null callback handler to be used by 
                      the SASL mechanisms to get further information 
                      from the application/library to complete the 
                      authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism 
                      might require the authentication ID, password and 
                      realm from the caller. The authentication ID is 
                      requested by using a NameCallback. The password 
                      is requested by using a PasswordCallback. The 
                      realm is requested by using a RealmChoiceCallback 
                      if there is a list of realms to choose from, and 
                      by using a RealmCallback if the realm must be 
                      entered.

4.1.2 setSaslClientFactory 
    
   public static void 
   setSaslClientFactory(SaslClientFactory fac) 
    
   Sets the default SaslClientFactory to use. This method sets fac to be 
   the default factory. It can only be called with a non-null value once 
   per VM. If a factory has been set already, this method throws 
   IllegalStateException. The method throws java.lang.SecurityException 
   if the caller does not have the necessary permission to set the 
   factory. 
    
   Parameters are: 
    
      fac            The possibly null factory to set. If null, it 
                     doesn't do anything. 
    

4.1.3 createSaslServer 
 
   public static SaslServer 
   createSaslServer(String mechanism, 
                    String protocol, 
                    String serverName, 
                    Hashtable props, 
                    javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler cbh) 
                    throws SaslException 
    
   This method creates a SaslServer for the specified mechanism. It 
   returns null if no SaslServer can be created for the specified 
   mechanism. 
    
   The algorithm for selection is as follows: 
    
   1. If a factory has been installed via setSaslServerFactory(), 
      invoke createSaslServer() on it. If the method invocation returns 
      a non-null SaslServer instance, return the SaslServer instance; 
      otherwise continue. 
   2. Create a list of fully qualified class names using the package 
      names listed in the SERVER_PKGS 
      ("javax.security.sasl.server.pkgs") property in props and the 
      class name ServerFactory. Each class name in this list identifies 
      a SaslServerFactory implementation. Starting with the first class 
      on the list, create an instance of SaslServerFactory using the 
      class' public no-argument constructor and invoke 
      createSaslServer() on it. If the method invocation returns a non-
      null SaslServer instance, return it; otherwise repeat using the 
      next class on the list until a non-null SaslServer is produced or 
      the list is exhausted. 
   3. Repeat the previous step using the SERVER_PKGS 
      ("javax.security.sasl.server.pkgs") System property instead of 
      the property in props.

4.1.7 Standard Properties 
    
   There are a number of properties that may be specified in a Hashtable 
   parameter when creating a SASL client or server. The standard 
   properties and descriptions of their values are as follows (with the 
   Sasl constant name followed by the literal value in parentheses):  
    
   QOP ("javax.security.sasl.qop") 
    
              A comma-separated, ordered list of quality-of-protection 
              values that the client or server is willing to support. A 
              qop value is one of 
    
              "auth"           authentication only 
               
              "auth-int"       authentication plus integrity protection 
               
              "auth-conf"      authentication plus integrity and 
                               confidentiality protection 
               
               
              The order of the list specifies the preference order of 
              the client or server. If this property is absent, the 
              default qop is "auth". 
    
   STRENGTH ("javax.security.sasl.strength") 
    
              A comma-separated, ordered list of cipher strength values 
              that the client or server is willing to support. A 
              strength value is one of 
               
              "low" 
               
              "medium" 
               
              "high" 
               
              The order of the list specifies the preference order of 
              the client or server. An implementation SHOULD allow 
              configuration of the meaning of these values. 
               
              An application MAY use the Java Cryptography Extension 
              (JCE) with JCE-aware mechanisms to control the selection 
              of cipher suites that match the strength values. 
               
              If this property is absent, the default strength is 
              "high,medium,low". 
    
   SERVER_AUTH ("javax.security.sasl.server.authentication")  
    
              "true" if server must authenticate to client; default 
              "false"

   MAX_BUFFER ("javax.security.sasl.maxbuffer") 
    
              Maximum size of receive buffer in bytes of 
              SaslClient/SaslServer; the default is defined by the 
              mechanism. The property value is the string 
              representation of an integer. 
    
   CLIENT_PKGS ("javax.security.sasl.client.pkgs") 
    
              A |-separated list of package names to use when locating 
              a SaslClientFactory. Each package MUST contain a class 
              named ClientFactory that implements the SaslClientFactory 
              interface. 
    
   SERVER_PKGS ("javax.security.sasl.server.pkgs") 
    
              A |-separated list of package names to use when locating 
              a SaslServerFactory. Each package MUST contain a class 
              named ServerFactory that implements the SaslServerFactory 
              interface. 
    
   RAW_SEND_SIZE ("javax.security.sasl.rawsendsize") 
    
              Maximum size of the raw send buffer in bytes of 
              SaslClient/SaslServer. The property value is the string 
              representation of an integer and is negotiated between 
              the client and server during the authentication exchange. 
    
   The following properties are for defining a security policy for a 
   server or client. Absence of the property is interpreted as "false".  
    
   POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT ("javax.security.sasl.policy.noplaintext") 
    
              "true"           if mechanisms susceptible to simple 
                               plain passive attacks (e.g. "PLAIN") are 
                               not permitted 
               
              "false"          if such mechanisms are permitted  
    
   POLICY_NOACTIVE ("javax.security.sasl.policy.noactive") 
    
              "true"           if mechanisms susceptible to active 
                               (non-dictionary) attacks are not 
                               permitted 
 
              "false"          if such mechanisms are permitted.  
    
   POLICY_NODICTIONARY ("javax.security.sasl.policy.nodictionary") 
    
              "true"           if mechanisms susceptible to passive 
                               dictionary attacks are not permitted

4.2 public interface SaslClient 
    
An object implementing this interface can negotiate authentication as a 
client using one of the IANA-registered mechanisms. 
    

4.2.1 evaluateChallenge 
    
   public byte[] 
   evaluateChallenge(byte[] challenge) 
                     throws SaslException 
    
   If a challenge is received from the server during the authentication 
   process, this method is called to prepare an appropriate next 
   response to submit to the server. The response is null if the 
   challenge accompanied a "SUCCESS" status and the challenge only 
   contains data for the client to update its state and no response 
   needs to be sent to the server. The response is a zero-length byte 
   array if the client is to send a response with no data. A 
   SaslException is thrown if an error occurred while processing the 
   challenge or generating a response. 
    
    
   Parameters are:

      challenge      The non-null challenge received from the server. 
                      The challenge array may have zero length. 
    

4.2.2 hasInitialResponse 
    
   public boolean hasInitialResponse() 
    
   Determines whether this mechanism has an optional initial response. 
   If true, caller should call evaluateChallenge() with an empty array 
   to get the initial response. 
    

4.2.3 isComplete 
    
   public boolean 
   isComplete() 
    
   This method may be called at any time to determine if the  
   authentication process is finished. Typically, the Protocol Driver 
   will not do this until it has received indication from the server (in 
   a protocol-specific manner) that the process has completed. 
    

4.2.4 unwrap 
    
   public byte[] unwrap(byte[] incoming, int offset, int len )  
                        throws SaslException  
        
   Unwraps a byte array received from the server to return the 
   corresponding decoded bytes in a byte array. 
    
   This method can be called only after the authentication process has 
   completed (i.e., when isComplete() returns true) and only if the 
   authentication process has negotiated integrity and/or privacy as the 
   quality of protection; otherwise, a SaslException is thrown. A 
   SaslException is thrown also if incoming cannot be successfully 
   unwrapped. 
    
   incoming is the contents of the SASL buffer as defined in [SASL] 
   without the leading four octet field that represents the length. 
   offset and len specify the portion of incoming to use. 
        
   Parameters are:  
    
      incoming       A non-null byte array containing the encoded 
                      bytes from the server. 
       
      offset         The starting position at incoming of the bytes to 
                      use.

      len            The number of bytes from incoming to use. 
    
    

4.2.5 wrap 
     
   public byte[] wrap(byte[] outgoing, int offset, int len) 
                      throws SaslException 
    
   Wraps a byte array to be sent to the server to return the 
   corresponding encoded bytes in a byte array. 
    
   This method can be called only after the authentication exchange has 
   completed (i.e., when isComplete() returns true) and only if the 
   authentication exchange has negotiated integrity and/or privacy as 
   the quality of protection; otherwise, a SaslException is thrown. A 
   SaslException is thrown also if outgoing cannot be successfully 
   wrapped. 
    
   The result of this method will make up the contents of the SASL 
   buffer as defined in [SASL] without the leading four octet field that 
   represents the length. 
    
   offset and len specify the portion of outgoing to use. 
    
   Parameters are: 
    
      outgoing       A non-null byte array containing the bytes to 
                      encode. 
       
      offset         The starting position at outgoing of the bytes to 
                      use. 
       
      len            The number of bytes from outgoing to use.

      mechanisms     The non-null list of mechanism names to try. Each  
                      is the IANA-registered name of a SASL mechanism 
                      (e.g. "GSSAPI", "CRAM-MD5"). 
       
      authorizationID  The possibly null protocol-dependent 
                      identification to be used for authorization. If 
                      null or empty, the server derives an 
                      authorization ID from the client's authentication 
                      credentials. When the SASL authentication 
                      completes successfully, the specified entity is 
                      granted access. 
       
      protocol       The non-null string name of the protocol for 
                      which the authentication is being performed, e.g 
                      "pop", "ldap". 
       
      serverName     The non-null fully qualified host name of the 
                      server to authenticate to. 
       
      props          The possibly null set of properties used to 
                      select the SASL mechanism and to configure the 
                      authentication exchange of the selected 
                      mechanism. See the Sasl class for a list of 
                      standard properties. Other, possibly mechanism-
                      specific, properties can be included. Properties 
                      not relevant to the selected mechanism are 
                      ignored. 
       
      cbh            The possibly null callback handler to be used by 
                      the SASL mechanisms to get further information 
                      from the application/library to complete the 
                      authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism 
                      might require the authentication ID, password and 
                      realm from the caller. The authentication ID is 
                      requested by using a NameCallback. The password 
                      is requested by using a PasswordCallback. The 
                      realm is requested by using a RealmChoiceCallback 
                      if there is a list of realms to choose from, and 
                      by using a RealmCallback if the realm must be

                      "true", then the factory must not return any SASL 
                      mechanisms that are susceptible to simple plain 
                      passive attacks. See the Sasl class for a

   evaluateResponse(byte[] response) 
                    throws SaslException 
    
   If a response is received from the client during the authentication 
   process, this method is called to prepare an appropriate next 
   challenge to submit to the client. The challenge is null if the 
   authentication has succeeded and no more challenge data is to be sent 
   to the client. It is non-null if the authentication must be continued 
   by sending a challenge to the client, or if the authentication has 
   succeeded but challenge data needs to be processed by the client. A 
   SaslException is thrown if an error occurred while processing the 
   response or generating a challenge. isComplete() should be called 
   after each call to evaluateResponse() to determine if any further 
   response is needed from the client. The Protocol Driver will send an 
   indication (in a protocol-specific manner) as to whether the 
   authentication has succeeded, failed, or should be continued, and any 
   accompanying challenge data.

      props          The possibly null set of properties to be used to 
                      select the SASL mechanism and to configure the 
                      authentication exchange of the selected 
                      mechanism. See the Sasl class for a list of 
                      standard properties. Other, possibly mechanism-
                      specific, properties can be included. Properties 
                      not relevant to the selected mechanism are 
                      ignored. 
       
         cbh            The possibly null callback handler to be used 
                      by the SASL mechanisms to get further information 
                      from the application/library to complete the 
                      authentication. For example, a SASL mechanism 
                      might require the authentication ID, password and 
                      realm from the caller. The authentication ID is 
                      requested by using a NameCallback. The password 
                      is requested by using a PasswordCallback. The 
                      realm is requested by using a RealmChoiceCallback 
                      if there is a list of realms to choose from, and 
                      by using a RealmCallback if the realm must be 
                      entered. 
    

4.5.2 getMechanismNames 
    
   public String[] 
   getMechanismNames(Hashtable props) 
    
   Returns a non-null array of names of mechanisms supported by this 
   factory that match the specified mechanism selection policies. 
    
   Parameters are: 
    
      props          The possibly null set of properties used to 
                      specify the security policy of the SASL 
                      mechanisms. For example, if props includes the 
                      Sasl.POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT property with the value 
                      "true", then the factory must not return any SASL 
                      mechanisms that are susceptible to simple plain 
                      passive attacks. See the Sasl class for a 
                      complete list of policy properties. Non-policy 
                      related properties, if present in props, are 
                      ignored. 
    

4.6 public class AuthorizeCallback 
                 implements javax.security.auth.callback.Callback 
    
This callback is used by SaslServer to determine whether one entity 
(identified by an authenticated authentication id) can act on behalf of 
another entity (identified by an authorization id).

   Constructs a new instance of SaslException with a detailed message 
   and a root exception. For example, a SaslException might result from 
   a problem with the callback handler, which might throw a 
   NoSuchCallbackException if it does not support the requested 
   callback, or throw an IOException if it had problems obtaining data 
   for the callback. The SaslException's root exception would then be 
   the exception thrown by the callback handler. 
    
    
   Parameters are: 
    
      message        Possibly null additional detail about the 
                     exception.

   nonexistent or unknown. The cause is the throwable that caused this 
   exception to be thrown. 
    

4.9.3 printStackTrace 
    
   public void 
   printStackTrace() 
    
   Prints this exception's stack trace to System.err. If this exception 
   has a root exception, the stack trace of the root exception is also 
   printed to System.err. 
    
   public void 
   printStackTrace(PrintStream ps) 
    
   Prints this exception's stack trace to a print stream. If this 
   exception has a root exception, the stack trace of the root exception 
   is also printed to the print stream. 
    
   public void 
   printStackTrace(PrintWriter pw) 
    
   Prints this exception's stack trace to a print writer. If this 
   exception has a root exception, the stack trace of the root exception 
   is also printed to the print writer.

   Parameters are: 
    
      ps             The non-null print stream to which to print. 
    
      pw             The non-null print writer to which to print. 
    
    
5. Security Considerations 
    
   When SASL authentication is performed over unsecured connections, it 
   is possible for an active attacker to spoof the server's protocol-
   specific indication that authentication is complete.  Clients should 
   protect against this attack by verifying the completion of 
   authentication with the Mechanism Driver by calling the driver's 
   isComplete() method. 
    
   Additional security considerations are discussed in [SASL].

   SaslClient, SaslServer 
    
   Added dispose() to allow security-sensitive information to be purged 
   from Mechanism Drivers deterministically. 
    
   Replaced getInputStream() and getOutputStream() with unwrap() and 
   wrap(), respectively, to remove dependency on stream-based I/O. 
    
   Replaced getNegotiatedQop() and getNegotiatedStrength() with the more 
   generic getNegotiatedProperty() to support access to other negotiated 
   properties.

   Changed getAuthenticationId() to getAuthenticationID(), 
   getAuthorizationId() to getAuthorizationID(), and getAuthorizedId() 
   to getAuthorizedID(). This was to conform to the naming convention 
   used in the rest of the API. 
    
    
11. Changes from draft-weltman-java-sasl-03.txt 
    
   Sasl 
    
   Added getClientFactories() and getServerFactories(). 
   Updated the list of standard properties. 
   Added the use of the J2SE version 1.3 service provider guidelines for 
   locating SaslClientFactory and SaslServerFactory implementations. 
    
    
   SaslClient 
    
   Added getNegotiatedQop() and getNegotiatedStrength() 
    
    
   SaslClientFactory and SaslServerFactory 
    
   getMechanismNames() takes a properties Hashtable as argument. 
    
    
   SaslServer 
    
   Added getNegotiatedQop() and getNegotiatedStrength() 
    
    
   AuthorizeCallback 
    
   New class to allow SaslServer to determine if an identity may be 
   authorized as another identity. 
    
    
   RealmCallback and RealmChoiceCallback 
    
   New classes for obtaining realm information. 
    
    
   SaslException 
    
   getRootException changed to getCause, in anticipation of a new 
   standard Java API for nested exceptions. Also, printStackTrace prints 
   both the current and the nested exception.

   The SecurityLayer interface was removed. 
    
    
   SaslClient 
    
   createInitialResponse() was removed. evaluateChallenge() accepts an 
   empty challenge and can return an initial response. 
   hasInitialResponse() was added to determine if the mechanism allows 
   for an initial client response. 
    
    
   SaslClient and SaslServer 
    
   getSecurityLayer() was replaced with getInputStream() and 
   getOutputStream(). 
    
   Package names are |-delimited, not space-delimited, in the pkgs 
   properties.
