1. Mechanism Names

   The family of SASL [RFC-2222] mechanisms associated with the protocol
   described in this document are named "SM2-<SASL mechanism name>"
   where <SASL mechanism name> is the canonical name of a SASL Mechanism
   other than SM2.  For example, "SM2-SRP" shall denote the SASL
   mechanism using the protocol described in this document with "SRP" as
   its underlying SASL mechanism.

   Note that a server advertising one or more SM2 mechanisms, does not
   preclude it from also advertising its support for the underlying
   mechanisms used in conjunction with SM2.  This ensures
   interoperability with clients that only support the underlying
   mechanisms but do not yet support that mechanism under SM2.  In other
   words, an SM2 mechanism constructed over an existing mechanism, say
   "SM2-SRP", is not a replacement for "SRP".  As such a server wanting,
   or able, to provide both mechanisms SHOULD advertise them both.

2. Introduction

   SM2 is a caching mechanism.  It relies on another SASL mechanism,
   referred to as the underlying mechanism, to perform authentication,
   and provide security services.  The underlying mechanism MUST NOT be
   SM2.

   Some SASL mechanisms, such as those based on the SRP protocol [SASL-
   SRP] and the Digest authentication [RFC-2831], provide authentication
   and the negotiation of a shared session key.  The operations involved
   in the establishement of connections relying on such mechanisms is
   time-consuming, especially when involving computations of
   cryptographic primitives and/or shared cryptographic keys.  It is
   desireable to allow both the client and the server, to be able to re-
   use those cryptographic elements, once negotiated in an initial
   exchange, without compromising the security of the communication.

   If two entities are using SM2 with the same underlying mechanism,
   they can bypass the authentication phase, on their second and
   subsequent connections, by re-using the security layer parameters
   negotiated during their initial exchange.

   A SASL mechanism is described in terms of its (a) authentication
   layer, and optionally its (b) security layer [RFC-2222].  It is worth
   noting straight away, that SM2 implies, but does not mandate, that
   the underlying SASL mechanism provides meaningful security services.
   In other words, the authors do not see any justification for a
   session-management based protocol constructed over an underlying
   mechanism that does not provide a non-trivial security layer.

3. Conventions Used in this Document

   1.  A hex digit is an element of the set:

          {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9, A, B, C, D, E, F}

       A hex digit is the representation of a 4-bit string.  Examples:

          7 = 0111

          A = 1010

   2.  An octet is an 8-bit string.  In this document an octet may be
       written as a pair of hex digits.  Examples:

          7A = 01111010

          02 = 00000010

       Depending on the context, one octet may be represented as
       described above preceded by "0x", for example 0x15 shall
       represent the 8-bit sequence 00010101.

   3.  All data is encoded and sent in network byte order (big-endian).

   4.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
       NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
       "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
       [RFC-2119].

4. Data Element Formats

   This section describes the encoding of the data elements used by the
   SASL mechanisms described in this document.

4.1 Scalar numbers

   Scalar numbers are unsigned quantities.  Using b[i] to refer to the
   i-th octet being processed, the value of a two-octet scalar is:

      ((b[0] << 8) + b[1]),

   where << is the bit left-shift operator.  The value of a four-octet
   scalar is:

      ((b[0] << 24) + (b[1] << 16) + (b[2] << 8) + b[3]).


4.2 Octet sequences

   These mechanisms generate, use and exchange sequences of octets.
   When such entities travel on the wire, they shall be preceded by a
   one-octet scalar quantity representing the count of following octets.

   We shall use the syntax os(s) to denote the encoded form of the octet
   sequence.

4.3 Extended octet sequences

   Extended sequences of octets are exchanged when using the security
   layer.  When these sequences travel on the wire, they shall be
   preceded by a four-octet scalar quantity representing the count of
   following octets.

   We shall use the syntax eos(s) to denote the encoded form of the
   extended octet sequence.

4.4 Text

   The only character set for text is the UTF-8 encoding [RFC-2279] of
   Unicode characters [ISO-10646].  All text MUST be in Unicode
   Normalization Form KC [UNICODE-KC] without NUL characters.

   We shall use the syntax utf8(L) to denote the string L in UTF-8
   encoding, preceded by a two-octet scalar quantity representing the
   count of following octets.

Internet-Draft           The SM2 SASL Mechanism            November 2001


4.5 Buffers

   In these SASL mechanisms data is exchanged between the client and
   server using buffers.  A buffer acts as an envelope for the sequence
   of data elements sent by one end-point of the exchange, and expected
   by the other.

   A buffer MAY NOT contain other buffers.  It may only contain zero,
   one or more data elements.

   A buffer shall be encoded as two fields: a four-octet scalar quantity
   representing the count of following octets, and the concatenation of
   the octets of the data element(s) contained in the buffer.

   We shall use the syntax {A|B|C} to denote a buffer containing A, B
   and C in that order.  For example:

      { 0x00 | utf8(umn) | eos(umir) }

   is a buffer containing, in the designated order, a 1-octet scalar
   quantity, and the encoded forms of a Text (umn) and an Extended Octet
   Sequence (umir).

4.6 Data element size limits

   The following table details the size limit, in number of octets, for
   each of the SASL data element encodings described earlier.

      Data element type          Header       Size limit in octets
                                (octets)       (excluding header)
      ------------------------------------------------------------
      Octet Sequence               1                  255
      Text                         2                 65,535
      Extended Octet Sequence      4             2,147,483,383
      Buffer                       4             2,147,483,643

   An implementation MUST signal an exception if any size constraint is
   violated.

4.7 Special octets

   In this mechanism certain octet values have special significance.
   These Octets, and the name that they will be referred to, are listed
   below:

   <NUL> The ASCII code point 0x00.  It signals the start of an
      "establishment of a new session" exchange.




Naffah & Taylor            Expires May 2, 2002                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           The SM2 SASL Mechanism            November 2001


   <SOH> The ASCII code point 0x01.  It signals the start of a "re-use
      session" exchange.

   <ACK> The ASCII code point 0x06.  It signals the server's acceptance
      of a client's request to re-use an existing session; and finally

   <NAK> The ASCII code point 0x15.  It signals the server's rejection
      of a client's request to re-use an existing session.

   When such entities travel on the wire, they shall be encoded as 1-
   octet Scalar numbers.

4.8 Unsigned Integers (UINT)

   This mechanism uses unsigned integer values ranging from zero to
   4,294,967,296.

   When such entities travel on the wire, they shall be encoded as 4-
   octet Scalar numbers.  We shall use the syntax uint(n) to denote the
   encoding of an Unsinged Integer n.

5. Protocol Description

   The next sections describe the messages exchanged between the SM2
   client and server, and their interaction with their peers in the
   underlying mechanism.

5.1 Establishment of a new session

   The establishment of a new SM2 session delegates to the underlying
   mechanism the authentication function.  Any parameters required by
   the underlying mechanism, MUST be passed into the SM2 mechanism when
   it is itself initialised.

   In an SM2 exchange, the client always initiates the exchange.

   The first SASL buffer sent by an SM2 client contains the Special
   Octet <NUL> indicating the initiation of the exchange, followed by
   the initial response, which might be 0-octet long, of the client's
   underlying mechanism.

   From this point on, the SM2 mechanism passes the challenges and
   responses to the underlying mechanism, and passes back the responses
   and challenges from the underlying mechanism to the peers.

   When the underlying mechanism exchange has concluded, the SM2 server
   sends (a) a session identifier and (b) a Time-To-Live (TTL)
   indication to the SM2 client.  The session identifier will be used by
   the SM2 client if/when it will later re-use this session, while the
   TTL indicates to the SM2 client, how long, in seconds, the SM2 server
   will attempt to keep valid this session's parameters for later re-use
   by the SM2 client.  A TTL indicator value of zero means that the
   session is valid forever.

   The following diagram shows the data exchanged in this process:

                                 ...

       <--------------------------- { utf8(sid) | uint(ttl) } --

   where:

      umir  the underlying mechanism initial response, if it has one,

      sid   the session identifier as set by the server.

      ttl   the session Time-To-Live indication in seconds.


5.2 Re-use of an existing session

   If two entities have already been through the authentication phase,
   and have both cached the security layer parameters, a shorter
   exchange may take place to re-use those parameters.

   In the exchange below, the Evidence fields (Ec for the client, and Es
   for the server) are octet strings, possibly 0-octet long, that
   represent mechanism-specific data.  An Evidence may be injected into
   the underlying mechanism peer's security layer context, to allow
   computation of a different shared secret for each re-use of the
   session.

   How a new shared secret is computed from a previously known value and
   an Evidence is an underlying mechanism specific issue.

   The mechanism data exchange for successfully re-using a session is
   shown below:

       -- { <SOH> | utf8(sid) | os(Ec) } ---------------------->

       <---------------------------------- { <ACK> | os(Es) } --

   where:

      Ec   the client evidence,

      Es   the server evidence.

   If the server accepts the request for re-using a session, it responds
   with the Special Octet <ACK> and its version of the Evidence (Es).

   On the other hand, if the server rejects the request for re-using a
   session (including the case where an unknown session identifier has
   been submitted), it responds with the Special Octet <NAK> only.  In
   this case, the SM2 client MUST attempt to establish a new session
   with the peer, and if this fails it MUST report an authentication
   failure.

   This retry facility MUST only be attempted once if re-using a session
   fails.

   The data exchange when failing to re-use a session is shown below:

6. Example

   The following sections show two examples: one for an establishment of
   a new SM2 session, and the second one is for a successful re-use of
   the session already established.  The underlying mechanism used with
   SM2 in both examples is an implementation of the SRP mechanism.
   Lines starting with "C" denote messages sent from the client side,
   while those stating with "S" are from the server side.

   The following is a detailed description of each step:

   C1: An SM2 Client initiates an establishment of a new session
      exchange.  The SASL buffer contains the <NUL> Octet, followed by
      the SRP client's initial response encoded as an Extended Octet
      Sequence.  The SRP client's initial response in this example is
      the Text 'test' representing U --the username.

   S1: The SM2 server engages in an "establishment of a new session"
      exchange.  It decodes the SRP client's initial response and passes
      it to its underlying SRP server object.  The SRP server evaluates
      the initial response and sends back a SASL buffer containing:

      1.  The MPI encoding of the public shared modulus N which in this
          example is 256-octet long.

      2.  The MPI encoding of the field generator g which in this
          example is 1-octet long (value 0x02),

      3.  The Octet Sequence encoding of the user's salt which in this
          example is 10-octet long, and finally

      4.  The 174-octet long Text containing the SRP server's available
          options.  In this example, this list consists of the string
          (white spaces added for clarity): mandatory = replay
          detection, replay detection, integrity = hmac-sha1, integrity
          = hmac-md5, confidentiality = aes, confidentiality = cast5,
          confidentiality = blowfish, maxbuffersize = 2147483643.

   C2: The SRP client responds to the SRP server challenge by returning
      a SASL buffer containing:

      1.  The 256-octet long MPI A representing the SRP client's
          ephemeral public key,

      2.  The 4-octet long Text 'test' representing the authorization ID
          for this exchange, and finally

      3.  The 85-octet long Text containing the client's chosen options
          list, which in this example is (white spaces added for

          clarity): replay detection, integrity = hmac-md5,
          confidentiality = blowfish, maxbuffersize = 2147483643".

   S2: The SRP server, issues a new challenge containing the 256-octet
      long MPI B representing the SRP server's ephemeral publick key.

   C3: The SRP client evaluates the server's challenge and responds with
      the 20-octet Octet Sequence representing its Evidence: M1.

   S3: The SM2 server terminates the exchange by sending to the SM2
      client the session ID generated for this session, followed by the
      TTL indicator.  In this example the session ID is the Text "SM2-
      SID-0000000001," while the TTL indicator is zero.


6.2 Example of an SM2 session re-use

   S1: 0000000606046526 1450

   The following is a detailed description of each step:

   C1: An SM2 Client initiates a session re-use exchange.  The SASL
      buffer contains:

      1.  The <SOH> Special Octet,

          example is "SM2-SID-0000000001," and finally

      3.  The Evidence of the underlying SRP client in use with the
          session in question.  In this example this evidence is 4-octet
          long.

   S1: The SM2 server accepts the request to re-use the identified
      session and sends back the <ACK> Special Octet followed by its
      version of the Evidence (which in this example is 4-octet long).

7. Discussion

7.1 Extending the Java SASL API

   The recently approved Java SASL API [JSR-28] contains a new property,
   javax.security.sasl.Sasl.REUSE, to serve as a hint when instantiating
   client and servers, for re-using previously authenticated session
   information.

   Appendix A contains a proposed set of interfaces that can be used by
   Java Security API Providers to offer modular implementations of SM2-
   capable SASL mechanisms.

   The two new interfaces in question, SaslClientExt and SaslServerExt
   extend SaslClient and SaslServer (from the javax.security.sasl
   package) respectively, and include appropriate methods to handle the
   SM2 protocole.

7.2 Beyond Java

   The authors intend this mechanism to be useful for implementations of
   SASL in languages other than Java.  However, such implementations
   MUST have the following capabilities to allow this mechanism to work:

   1.  A mechanism can create another mechanism.

   2.  The SASL Security Context, containing the crpytographic
       parameters of a mechanism may be extracted in a form that can be
       stored in a cache.

   3.  A mechanism (or a security layer) can be [re-]initialised from a
       SASL Security Context containing cryptographic parameters stored
       in a cache.


7.3 Cache management

   After a new session is successfully established, the SM2 server sends
   a session identifier to the client (see Figure 2).  It is the
   responsibility of the client to ensure that it will be able to re-use
   this value in the future.  In other words, the SM2 client should have
   access to a mapping function that looks up a session identifier to
   re-use, from data included in a request to instantiate a new
   underlying mechanism client.  If such a session is found, then the
   SM2 client would only need to 'recreate' the underlying client with
   the SASL Security Context of that session.

7.4 DIGEST-MD5 as an underlying mechanism for SM2

   The proposed SASL mechanism DIGEST-MD5 describes a mechanism for re-
   use of some data negotiated in a previous exchange (section 2.2
   "Subsequent Authentication" in [RFC-2831]).  More specifically:

      "If the client has previously authenticated to the server, and
      remembers the values of username, realm, nonce, nonce-count,
      cnonce, and qop that it used in that authentication, and the SASL
      profile for a protocol permits an initial client response, then it
      MAY perform "subsequent authentication", as defined in this
      section."

   Such a mechanism can be used as an underlying mechanism for SM2.  The
   following notes clarify the previous statement:

   1.  An "Initial Authentication" (section 2.1 of [RFC-2831]) is the
       exchange used in an SM2 establishment of a new session.

   2.  The SASL Security Context parameters for a DIGEST-MD5
       implementation SHOULD include: username, realm, nonce, nonce-
       count, cnonce, and qop (described in section 2.1.2 of [RFC-2831].

   3.  The client's Evidence Ec in an SM2 session re-use exchange, is a
       full DIGEST-MD5 "digest-response" as described in section 2.2.1
       of [RFC-2831].

   4.  If the DIGEST-MD5 client's mechanism "digest-response" is valid,
       and the the DIGEST-MD5 server chose to deem that authentication
       has succeeded, the SM2 server can successfully conclude a session
       re-use exchnage.

   5.  If the DIGEST-MD5 client's mechanism "digest-response" is
       invalid, or if it is valid but the DIGEST-MD5 server decides to
       refresh the authentication parameters by sending a new "digest-
       challenge", then an SM2 failed session re-use message should be
       sent back to the SM2 client.

8. Security Considerations

8.1 Caching cryptographic parameters

   SM2 relies on the ability to extract and cache the cryptographic
   parameters from an underlying mechanism --the SASL Security Context--
   , and to initialise an instance of the underlying mechanism client
   and/or server with that cached context.  One might argue against this
   practice for security reasons.  Yet, most cryptographic software
   modules have their parameters somewhere in the program memory, so SM2
   is as safe as those modules.

   In addition, if a salt is used (the Evidence or part of it), the
   actual values used for each exchange will be different.  This is a
   similar concept to caching TLS [RFC-2246] sessions and hence SM2,
   coupled with a strong underlying mechanism, should be no less secure.

8.2 Flexibility to use new authentication mechanisms

   By using a second authentication mechanism to do the actual
   authentication function, SM2 can always be configured to use the
   latest, proven, authentication techniques for which a SASL mechanism
   has been specified and implemented.

8.3 When to invalidate a session

   The server MUST discard the existing session information when an
   attempt to re-use the session fails.  The server MUST cache the SASL
   Security Context for a session only when a new one is established and
   after the authentication function is successfully completed.

   Bound by the above rule, an SM2 server is thus susceptible to a
   denial-of-service like attack.  Indeed, an attacker may repeatedly
   attempt to re-use sessions, thus causing the server to invalidate
   those sessions soon after they were established.

   But this would be no different to the attacker carrying out her
   attack on the underlying mechanism server if/when SM2 is not used.
   The result of such an attack would be that the full underlying
   authentication procedure would take place.

8.4 Updating the SASL Security Context from the Evidence

   The SM2 mechanism will use the security layer provided by its
   underlying mechanism.

   The cryptographic parameters of this security layer, contained in a
   SASL Security Context, are cached when the authentication phase is

   complete.  These parameters may be varied on a per-connection basis
   by means of the optional Evidence parameter passed in during the
   session re-use exchange (see Figure 3).

   What if that Evidence is not enough to update the cryptographic
   parameters to an acceptable security level; e.g.  a weak key is
   obtained? Two alternatives are possible:

   1.  An implementation may contain a recovery mechanism that would
       allow it to continue the algorithm until a valid and acceptable
       value is obtained, or

   2.  An implementation may cause an error condition that would be
       intercepted by the SM2 peer.  If it was the client, then a new
       session would be negotiated, otherwise if it is the server, then
       a failed re-use of a session reply would be returned (see Figure
       4).

Appendix A. Proposed extension to the Java SASL API

   In the next sections, the type AlgorithmParamterSpec is imported from
   the java.security.spec package.

A.1 public interface SaslClientExt

   An interface that extends the SaslClient interface.

   An object implementing this interface can negotiate authentication
   using one of the IANA-registered mechanisms, and be used as a client-
   side underlying mechanism for the SM2 mechanism.

A.1.1 getSaslSecurityContext

         AlgorithmParameterSpec
         getSaslSecurityContext()
         throws SaslException;

   Retrieves an object that encapsulates the SASL Security Context
   parameters for future re-use.  This method can be called only after
   the authentication exchange has completed (i.e., when isComplete()
   returns true); otherwise, a SaslException is thrown.

A.1.2 setSaslSecurityContext

         void
         setSaslSecurityContext(AlgorithmParameterSpec ctx)
         throws SaslException;

   Replaces the current SASL Security Context parameters of an object
   with those encapsulated in the designated argument.

   Parameter is:

   ctx
      The designated instance of the object encapsulating the new values
      of SASL Security Context parameters to use after successful
      completion of this method.

A.1.3 evaluateEvidence

         byte[]
         evaluateEvidence(byte[] peerEvidence)
         throws SaslException;

   Computes new values for all or some of the SASL Security Context
   parameters and returns an Evidence that will be sent to the peer.

   The rationale for this method is to (a) allow the peers to 're-cycle'
   their cryptographic paramemeters so each re-use of the exchange would
   be based on different values every time; and (b) allow the peers to
   check, in the absence of a full authentication exchange, that the
   peer really knows more than just the session ID.

   This method throws a SaslException if during the process of updating
   the SASL Security Context parameters, or while generating the
   Evidence, it encounters an exception.

   Parameter is:

   peerEvidence
      The peer's Evidence as received in a session re-use exchange.


A.2 public interface SaslServerExt

   An interface that extends the SaslServer interface.

   An object implementing this interface can negotiate authentication
   using one of the IANA-registered mechanisms, and be used as a server-
   side underlying mechanism for the SM2 mechanism.

A.2.1 getSaslSecurityContext

         AlgorithmParameterSpec
         getSaslSecurityContext()
         throws SaslException;

   Retrieves an object that encapsulates the SASL Security Context
   parameters for future re-use.  This method can be called only after
   the authentication exchange has completed (i.e., when isComplete()
   returns true); otherwise, a SaslException is thrown.

A.2.2 setSaslSecurityContext

         void
         setSaslSecurityContext(AlgorithmParameterSpec ctx)
         throws SaslException;

   Replaces the current SASL Security Context parameters of an object
   with those encapsulated in the designated argument.

   Parameter is:

   ctx
      The designated instance of the object encapsulating the new values
      of SASL Security Context parameters to use after successful
      completion of this method.


A.2.3 evaluateEvidence

         byte[]
         evaluateEvidence(byte[] peerEvidence)
         throws SaslException;

   Computes new values for all or some of the SASL Security Context
   parameters and returns an Evidence that will be sent to the peer.

   The rationale for this method is to (a) allow the peers to 're-cycle'
   their cryptographic paramemeters so each re-use of the exchange would
   be based on different values every time; and (b) allow the peers to
   check, in the absence of a full authentication exchange, that the
   peer really knows more than just the session ID.

   This method throws a SaslException if during the process of updating
   the SASL Security Context parameters, or while generating the
   Evidence, it encounters an exception.

   Parameter is:

   peerEvidence
      The peer's Evidence as received in a session re-use exchange.
