Abstract

   Almost every protocol needs authentication.  However, there does not
   exist an authentication mechanism suitable for all organizations, nor
   is it likely that a small fixed set of authentication mechanisms will
   remain suitable.  SASL [SASL] provides the on-the-wire framework for
   authentication (and a security layer) which separates the design of
   authentication mechanisms from the protocols in which they're used.

   The SASL protocol model suggests a software architecture where
   application protocols call a generic API to authenticate which in
   turn calls a generic plug-in interface for extensible authentication
   modules.  This memo documents the API used in one implementation of
   this architecture in the hope that it will be useful to others.  An
   associated memo documenting the plug-in interface is forthcoming.

1.     Conventions Used in this Memo

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
   use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS].

   This assumes familiarity the SASL [SASL] specification.

   When describing function parameters the following conventions are
   used: IN before the parameter means that the function expects this
   paramer to be specified; OUT means that the function sets the
   parameter upon return; INOUT means that the function requires the
   parameter to be specified and will update its value upon return.

 1.1.   Concepts

   The following concepts are necessary to understand this
   specification.

realm
     A realm is a name (usually a domain-style name) associated with a
     set of users on a server.  One realm may span multiple servers.
     Alternatively, a single server may have multiple realms.  Thus
     there may be multiple users with the username "chris" on the same
     server, each in a different realm.  Some authentication mechanisms
     have a special field for the realm (e.g., DIGEST-MD5).  For other
     mechanisms, a realm can be specified by the client by using the
     syntax "username@realm" in the username field.

service
     A service is a basic function provided by one or more protocols.
     The GSSAPI service name [GSSAPI] registry is available at:

      <http://www.iana.org/numbers.html#G>

     This registry is used by SASL and the SASL API. The service name
     may be used for service-specific passwords for advanced users, or
     advanced authentication mechanisms may restrict the services a
     given server may offer.


virtual domain
     When a single server has multiple realms and there is a DNS server
     entry for each realm pointing to the same server IP address, then
     those realms are "virtual domains".  Virtual domains are extremely
     popular with web hosting services and are becoming more popular
     with POP mail services.  The key to providing virtual domain sup-
     port is that the client informs the server of the domain it
     believes it is speaking to either through a special protocol ele-
     ment or by using a username of the form "user@realm".


2.     Overview of the SASL C API

   The SASL API is initialized once at process startup. The
   sasl_server_init() and sasl_client_init() functions provide basic
   initialization.

   When a network connection occurs where SASL will be used, a connec-
   tion-specific context is created for authentication with
   sasl_client_new() or sasl_server_new().  The API implementation must
   support multi-threaded servers and clients by creating the connection
   context in a thread-safe fashion permitting multiple contexts in a
   given process.  At this point, the caller may adjust security policy
   for the context, and the set of mechanisms which are enabled is
   determined by requirements from the configuration or by the caller.

INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


   The server end of the API may request a list of enabled authentica-
   tion mechanisms either in general or for a specific user.  The client
   may either select a single mechanism or request a list from the
   server (if the SASL profile for the protocol in question supports
   that) and pass the list to the API for automated mechanism selection
   by configured policy.

   The SASL exchange begins with sasl_client_start() which determines if
   one of the desired mechanisms is available on the client and may gen-
   erate an initial client response.  The client then sends the appro-
   priate protocol message to initiate the SASL exchange that the server
   passes to sasl_server_start().

   The SASL exchange continues with calls to sasl_client_step() and
   sasl_server_step(), until the server indicates completion or the
   client cancels the exchange.

   The server queries the user name and user realm resulting from the
   exchange with the sasl_getprop() routine.

   A connection context is released with sasl_dispose() and process ter-
   mination is indicated with sasl_done().

   There are a number of utility functions and customization functions
   available in the API for additional services.

   Note, that all functions described in this document can be imple-
   mented as macroses, so an application using this API MUST NOT assume
   that they are functions.

   An application or library trying to use the SASL API described in
   this document must include "sasl.h" include file.

3.     Basic SASL API Routines

   This section describes the types and functions likely to be used by
   every caller of the SASL API.

 3.1.   Basic SASL API Data Structures

   The following datastructures are basic to the SASL API.

  3.1.1. sasl_callback_t

   The sasl_callback_t structure is used for the caller of the SASL API
   to provide services to both the core SASL API and SASL mechanisms via
   callbacks.  The most important callback is the "getopt" callback (see
   section 3.3.3) which is used to retrieve security policy option

INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


   settings from the caller's preferences.

   typedef struct sasl_callback {
       unsigned int id;
       int (*proc)();
       void *context;
   } sasl_callback_t;

   id is the label for the callback (XXX IANA registry needed), proc is
   a function pointer whose exact type is determined by the id, and con-
   text is a context variable which will be passed to the callback (usu-
   ally as the first argument).  The last callback in the list of call-
   backs is indicated with an id of SASL_CB_LIST_END.

   If proc is NULL, this means that the application doesn't want to
   specify a corresponding callback, but would provide the necessary
   data via interaction.  See also section 3.1.4.

   A SASL mechanism has a list of required callbacks. If all the
   required callbacks are not provided by the calling application (or
   not handled as interactions), the SASL mechanism is not going to be
   selected. Thus it is necessary to list all callbacks that are pro-
   vided by the application and list all interactions as callbacks with
   proc as NULL.

  3.1.2. sasl_secret_t

   The sasl_secret_t structure is used to hold text or binary passwords
   for the client API.

   typedef struct sasl_secret {
       unsigned int len;
       unsigned char data[1];
   } sasl_secret_t;

   The len field holds the length of the password, while the data field
   holds the actual data.  The structure is variable sized: enough space
   must be reserved after the data field to hold the desired password.
   An additional '\0' character (not counted in len) is added at the
   end.  Note, however, that binary passwords are permitted to contain
   '\0' characters.

  3.1.3. sasl_conn_t

   The sasl_conn_t data type is an opaque data type which reflects the
   SASL context for a single server connection.  Only one SASL API call
   using a given sasl_conn_t as an argument may be active at a time.
   However, each sasl_conn_t is independent and thus the SASL API may be

   used in a true multi-processor multi-threaded environment.

  3.1.4. sasl_interact_t

   The sasl_interact_t structure is used by sasl_client_start and
   sasl_client_step to request certain information from the application,
   when the application did not provide corresponding callbacks. For
   example, an application may choose to present a single dialog to the
   user in order to collect all required information interactively.

   typedef struct sasl_interact {
       unsigned int id;
       const char *challenge;
       const char *prompt;
       const char *defresult;
       const void *result;
       unsigned len;
   } sasl_interact_t;

   The id field holds the value of the callback ID. The prompt field
   contains a string that should be presented to the user. If non-NULL,
   challenge is a NUL-terminated string that will allow the user to
   present a specific credential when prompted. This is different from
   the prompt in that the prompt is more like a label for a text box
   (for example "Response:" while challenge is a string that tells the
   user what specifically is required by the response (for example, an
   OTP challenge string). The defresult field contains a default value,
   if any. Upon return from sasl_client_* the "result" field points to
   the defresult. The client must present the information in the chal-
   lenge and the prompt to the user and store the result and its length
   in the result and the len fields respectively.

   For example, SASL_CB_PASS interaction may contain the following
   information:
    id - SASL_CB_PASS
    challenge - NULL
    prompt - "Password:"
    defresult - NULL (no default).

 3.2.   Basic SASL API Client Routines

   This section discusses the functions likely to be used by every
   client caller of the SASL API.

  3.2.1. sasl_client_init function






Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004          FORMFEED[Page 7]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


Arguments:
            sasl_callback_t *callbacks

Results:
            SASL_OK        -- Success
            SASL_NOMEM     -- Not enough memory
            SASL_BADVERS   -- Mechanism version mismatch
            SASL_BADPARAM  -- Error in config file

      This function initializes the client routines for the SASL API.

      The callbacks argument is the default list of callbacks (see sec-
      tion 3.1.1 for definition of sasl_callback_t structure).
      Libraries that are clients of the API MUST supply NULL For this
      parameter.  Applications that are clients of the API MAY supply a
      list that includes the sasl_getopt_t callback (see section 3.3.3),
      but MUST NOT supply any other callbacks through this interface. An
      application or library that needs to specify other callbacks shall
      use prompt_supp parameter of the sasl_client_new (see section
      3.2.2).

      On success, SASL_OK is returned, and on failure a SASL C API error
      code such as the ones listed above is returned.  This function may
      be called a second time to change the global sasl_getopt_t call-
      back used for new connections, but the first call must be made in
      a single-threaded environment.

      There must be a call to sasl_done for every successful call to
      sasl_server_init or sasl_client_init made. Each call to
      sasl_server_init or sasl_client_init increment the internal refer-
      ence counter. All but the last call to sasl_done descrement the
      counter, the final sasl_done does the actual cleanup.  The data
      referenced by the sasl_callback_t structure must persist until the
      very last call to sasl_done().

  3.2.2. sasl_client_new function

Arguments:
            const char *service,
            const char *server_name,
            const char *iplocalport,
            const char *ipremoteport,
            const sasl_callback_t *prompt_supp,
            unsigned int flags,
            sasl_conn_t **pconn

Results:
            SASL_OK        -- Success
            SASL_NOTINIT   -- SASL API not initialized
            SASL_NOMECH    -- No mechanisms available
            SASL_NOMEM     -- Not enough memory

      This function creates a client connection context variable.  As
      long as each thread uses its own connection context, the SASL C
      API is thread-safe.

      The service argument is an IANA registered GSSAPI service element
      as defined in section 1.1.  It MUST NOT be NULL.

      The server_name is the host name or IP address of the server to
      which the client is connecting. NULL may be used for server_name,
      but may result in advanced mechanisms such as Kerberos being
      unavailable.

      The iplocalport is the string with the client IPv4/IPv6 address,
      followed by ":" and than by port number. The syntax of IPv4/IPv6
      addresses is defined by IPv4address/IPv6address ABNF elements from
      [RFC 2373]. NULL may be used for iplocalport, but may result in
      mechanisms requiring IP address being unavailable.

      The ipremoteport is the string with the server IPv4/IPv6 address,
      followed by ":" and than by port number. The syntax of IPv4/IPv6
      addresses is defined by IPv4address/IPv6address ABNF elements from
      [RFC 2373]. NULL may be used for ipremoteport, but may result in
      mechanisms requiring IP address being unavailable.

      User input to the SASL C API may be provided in two ways: either
      by supplying callbacks (prompt_supp) to this function, or by using
      an interaction model with the sasl_client_start/sasl_client_step
      functions. Callbacks are more convenient to obtain information
      programmatically, such as pulling authentication information
      directly from a configuration file. Interactions are more conve-
      nient if one wants to get all the data in parallel, for example by

      displaying a single dialog box instead of a separate popup for
      authentication name, authorization, password, etc.

      The prompt_supp is a list of supported user prompting callbacks
      discussed in the section 3.1.1. The prompt_supp argument MAY be
      NULL, which means that interactions (i.e. prompt_need parameter to
      sasl_client_start (see 3.2.3) and sasl_client_step (see 3.2.4))
      are used instead of callbacks. If prompt_supp is NULL, the
      prompt_need argument to sasl_client_start (see 3.2.3) and
      sasl_client_step (see 3.2.4) MUST NOT be NULL.

      The prompt_supp argument may include a connection-specific
      sasl_getopt_t callback. If a connection-specific sasl_getopt_t
      callback is specified in the prompt_supp list, it will take prece-
      dence over the global sasl_getopt_t callback specified in the last
      sasl_client_init() call.

      A SASL mechanism has a list of required callbacks. If all the
      required callbacks are not provided by the calling application (or
      not handled as interactions), the SASL mechanism is not going to
      be selected. Thus it is necessary to list all callbacks that are
      provided by the application and list all interactions as callbacks
      with proc as NULL.

      The flags argument represents client-supported security flags.
      The value is a bitmask. Currently, only two values are defined:
      SASL_SUCCESS_DATA and SASL_NEED_PROXY.

      The SASL_SUCCESS_DATA flag specifies that the server (and the pro-
      tocol) supports sending "additional data on success". This flag is
      used by the SASL library to decide whether it can pass the success
      data back along with SASL_OK, or if it must return SASL_CONTINUE
      and then wait for an empty client response before returning
      SASL_OK.

      The SASL_NEED_PROXY flag tells the SASL library that it must only
      select mechanisms that support proxy authorization.

      The pconn argument is set to point to the newly created connection
      context.  The sasl_conn_t type is opaque to the calling applica-
      tion.

  3.2.3. sasl_client_start function

INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t *conn,
            const char *mechlist,
            sasl_interact_t **prompt_need,
            const char **clientout,
            unsigned int *clientoutlen,
            const char **mech

Results:
            SASL_NOTINIT   -- SASL API not initialized
            SASL_BADPARAM  -- conn or mechlist is NULL
            SASL_NOMECH    -- No matching mechanisms available
            SASL_NOMEM     -- Not enough memory
            SASL_INTERACT  -- User interaction needed to continue
                              (see prompt_need description below)
            SASL_OK        -- Success

      This selects an authentication mechanism to use and optionally
      generates an initial client response.

      The conn argument is the connection context from sasl_client_new.

      The mechlist argument is a '\0' terminated string containing one
      or more SASL mechanism names.  All characters in the string that
      are not permitted in a SASL mechanism name [SASL] are ignored
      except for the purposes of delimiting mechanism names (this per-
      mits passing direct results from many protocol capability lists
      unparsed).  Unknown mechanism names are ignored (although
      SASL_NOMECH is returned if no known mechanisms are found).  Mecha-
      nisms are tried in an implementation-dependent order. Implementa-
      tions SHOULD try to use the most secure mechanism possible, within
      the constraints specified by the application (e.g. SSF value).  If
      the application wants to control which mechanism from the list
      would be selected, it has to break the list apart and call the
      function by passing a single SASL mechanism name at a time in the
      mech_list parameter.

      For applications which support interactions, the prompt_need argu-
      ment should initially point to a NULL pointer. If the selected
      mechanism needs information from the user (for example, username
      or password), then prompt_need will be set to point to an array of
      sasl_interact_t structures (terminated by an entry with id equal
      to SASL_CB_LIST_END), and sasl_client_start will return
      SASL_INTERACT.  After that the client must fill in the requested
      information and call this function again with the same parameters.

      Applications that do not support interactions MUST pass NULL for
      prompt_need.

      The clientout and clientoutlen parameters are set to the initial
      client response, if any.  If a protocol's SASL profile uses base64
      encoding, this represents the data prior to the encoding (see
      sasl_encode64).  If a protocol's SASL profile doesn't include an
      optional initial client response, then these may be NULL and 0
      respectively. The memory used by clientout is interally managed by
      the SASL API and may be overwritten on the next call to
      sasl_client_step or a call to sasl_dispose.

      The mech argument is set to point to a '\0' terminated string
      specifying the mechanism actually selected using all uppercase
      letters.  It may be NULL if the client does not care which mecha-
      nism was selected from mechlist.

      If sasl_client_start is called a second time using the same con-
      nection context, it will discard any cached information (e.g., the
      username and password) and restart the exchange as if this were
      the first call to the sasl_client_start.

  3.2.4. sasl_client_step function

Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t *conn,
            const char *serverin,
            unsigned int serverinlen,
            sasl_interact_t **prompt_need,
            const char **clientout,
            unsigned int *clientoutlen

Results:
            SASL_NOTINIT     -- SASL API not initialized
            SASL_NOMECH      -- sasl_client_start not called
            SASL_BADPROT     -- server protocol incorrect/cancelled
            SASL_BADSERV     -- server failed mutual auth
            SASL_INTERACT    -- user interaction needed
            SASL_OK          -- success

      This routine performs one step in an authentication sequence.

      The conn argument must be a connection context created by
      sasl_client_new and used in a previous call to sasl_client_start.

      The serverin and serverinlen parameters hold the SASL octet string
      received from the server.  Note that for those SASL profiles which
      base64 encode the exchange, this is the result after the removal
      of the base64 encoding (see the sasl_decode64 routine below). The
      serverin may contain arbitrary binary data, in particular it MAY
      contain one or more NUL characters. The serverin MUST have a

      terminating NUL character not counted by serverinlen.

      The prompt_need argument is the same as for sasl_client_start.

      The clientout and clientoutlen parameters hold the SASL octet
      string to encode (if necessary) and send to the server.

 3.3.   Basic SASL API Callback Routines

      This section describes the basic callback functions needed for a
      simple client implementation.  See the definition of sasl_call-
      back_t in section 3.1.1 for a description of the basic callback
      structure.

  3.3.1. sasl_getsimple_t

Arguments:
            void *context,
            int id,
            const char **result,
            unsigned *len

Results:
            SASL_OK          -- success
            SASL_FAIL        -- error

      This callback is used by the SASL API to request a simple constant
      string from the application.  This is used with id SASL_CB_USER
      for the username, SASL_CB_AUTHNAME for the authentication name (if
      different), and SASL_CB_LANGUAGE for a comma separated list of
      [LANGTAGS] language tags.

      The context is the context variable from the sasl_callback_t
      structure, the id is the id from the sasl_callback_t structure,
      and the callback is expected to set the result to a constant
      string and the len to the length of that string.  The result and
      len parameters are never NULL.

  3.3.2. sasl_getsecret_t












Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 13]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


Arguments:
            IN sasl_conn_t *conn,
            IN void *context,
            IN int id,
            OUT sasl_secret_t **psecret

Results:
            SASL_OK          -- success
            SASL_FAIL        -- error

      This callback is expected to create, prompt or locate a secret and
      return the pointer to it in the psecret parameter. The secret MUST
      persist till next call to this callback/sasl_dispose for the same
      SASL connection. The conn argument is the connection context, the
      context and id parameters are from the sasl_callback_t structure.
      The id SASL_CB_PASS is used to request a clear text password. The
      conn and the psecret parameters MUST NOT be NULL.

      Returning SASL_OK with psecret set to NULL should indicate a user
      desire to cancel the authentication sequence (e.g., user pressed
      Cancel in a password dialog box).

  3.3.3. sasl_getopt_t

Arguments:
            void *context,
            const char *plugin_name,
            const char *option,
            const char **result,
            unsigned int *len

Results:
            SASL_OK          -- success
            SASL_FAIL        -- error

      This callback is used by the SASL API to read options from the
      application.  This allows a SASL configuration to be encapsulated
      in the caller's configuration system. Configuration items may be
      mechanism-specific and are arbitrary strings. If the application
      does not provide a sasl_getopt_t callback, then the API MAY obtain
      configuration information from other sources, for example from a
      default config file.

      The context is the context variable from the sasl_callback_t
      structure, the plugin_name is the name of plugin (or NULL), the
      option is the option name, and the callback is expected to set the
      result to a string valid till next call to sasl_getopt_t in the
      same thread and the len to the length of that string.  The result

      and len parameters are never NULL. If the name of plugin is NULL,
      a general SASL option is requested, otherwise a plugin specific
      version.

 3.4.   Basic SASL C API Utility Routines

      This section describes utility functions provided as part of the
      SASL API which may be used both by clients and servers.

  3.4.1. sasl_decode64 function

Arguments:
            const char *in,
            unsigned int inlen,
            char *out,
            unsigned int outmax,
            unsigned int *outlen

Results:
            SASL_BUFOVER    -- output buffer too small
            SASL_BADPROT    -- invalid base64 string
            SASL_OK         -- successful decode

      This utility routine converts a base64 string of length inlen
      pointed by in into an octet string. It is useful for SASL profiles
      which use base64 such as the IMAP [IMAP4] and POP [POP-AUTH] pro-
      files.  The output is copied to the buffer specified by the out
      parameter.  It is NUL terminated and the length of the output is
      placed in the outlen parameter if outlen is non-NULL. The lenght
      doesn't include the terminating NUL character.

      When the size of the output buffer, as specified by outmax, is too
      small, the function returns SASL_BUFOVER error code and the
      required length is stored in the outlen parameter if it is not
      NULL.

      The function may also return SASL_BADPROT error code when it
      encounters an invalid base64 character.

  3.4.2. sasl_encode64 function











Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 15]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


Arguments:
            const char *in,
            unsigned int inlen,
            char *out,
            unsigned int outmax,
            unsigned int *outlen

Results:
            SASL_BUFOVER    -- output buffer too small
            SASL_OK         -- successful decode

      This utility routine converts an octet string of length inlen
      pointed by in into a base64 string. It is useful for SASL profiles
      which use base64 such as the IMAP [IMAP4] and POP [POP-AUTH] pro-
      files.

      The output is copied to the buffer specified by the out parameter.
      It is NUL terminated and the length of the output is placed in the
      outlen parameter if outlen is non-NULL. The lenght doesn't include
      the terminating NUL character.

      When the size of the output buffer, as specified by outmax, is too
      small, the function returns SASL_BUFOVER error code and the
      required length is stored in the outlen parameter if it is not
      NULL.

  3.4.3. sasl_errstring function

Arguments:
            int saslerr,
            const char *langlist,
            const char **outlang

Results:
            const char *

      This converts a SASL error number into a constant string.  The
      second argument MAY be NULL for the default language, or a comma-
      separated list of [LANGTAGS] language tags.  The final parameter
      is set (if not NULL) to the [LANGTAGS] language tag of the string
      returned which will be "i-default" if no matching language is
      found.  The strings are UTF-8.  This requires no context so it may
      be used for the result of an sasl_*_init or sasl_*_new result
      code.

  3.4.4. sasl_errdetail function





Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 16]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t *conn

Results:
            const char *

      This function returns a human readable string that corresponds to
      the last SASL error that occured on the connection. The string
      MUST be in UTF8.  This string is suitable to be passed back over
      the protocol and presented to an end-user. Thus, it must not leak
      a security sensitive information, e.g. it must not show the dis-
      tinction between "user not found" and "bad password".

      The function must use the SASL_CB_LANGUAGE callback (see section
      3.3.1) to determine the language to use. It may return more
      detailed information than sasl_errstring does.

  3.4.5. sasl_seterror function

Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t *conn
            unsigned flags,
            const char *fmt,
             ...

Results:
            none

      This function sets sets the error string which will be returned by
      sasl_errdetail.  It uses syslog()-style formatting (i.e. printf-
      style with %m as the string form of an errno error).

      Messages should be sensitive to the current language setting. If
      there is no SASL_CB_LANGUAGE callback for the connection, text
      MUST be in US-ASCII.  Otherwise UTF-8 is used and use of RFC 2482
      for mixed-language text is encouraged.

      <<This will also trigger a call to the SASL logging callback (if
      any) with a level of SASL_LOG_FAIL unless the SASL_NOLOG flag is
      set.>>

      The resulting formatted string should be stored in connection con-
      text until connection context is destroyed or a next call to
      sasl_seterror() and can be retrieved by calling sasl_getprop with
      SASL_PLUGERR property.

      This function may be used by server callbacks.

INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


      If conn is NULL, the function does nothing.

  3.4.6. sasl_erasebuffer function

Arguments:
            char *buf,
            unsigned len

Results:
            none

      This function fills the buffer buf of the length len with '\0'
      characters.  The function may be used to clear from memory sensi-
      tive informations, like passwords.

 3.5.   Basic SASL C API Server Routines

      This section describes the basic routines for a server implementa-
      tion of a SASL profile.

  3.5.1. sasl_server_init function

Arguments:
            const sasl_callback_t *callbacks,
            const char *appname

Results:
            SASL_BADPARAM     -- error in config file
            SASL_NOMEM        -- out of memory
            SASL_BADVERS      -- Plug-in version mismatch
            SASL_OK           -- success

      This function initializes the server routines for the SASL C API.

      The callbacks argument is the default list of callbacks (see sec-
      tion 3.1.1 for definition of sasl_callback_t structure).
      Libraries that are clients of the API MUST supply NULL for this
      parameter.  Applications that are clients of the API MAY supply a
      list that includes the sasl_getopt_t callback (see section 3.3.3),
      but MUST NOT supply any other callbacks through this interface. An
      application or library that needs to specify other callbacks shall
      use callbacks parameter of the sasl_server_new (see section
      3.5.2).

      The appname argument is the name of the calling application. SASL
      API may use it, for example, for logging or to read an application
      specific configuration.  A library must pass NULL as appname. app-
      name can be also be set with sasl_setprop function, and can be

      queried with sasl_getprop. The corresponding constant for the app-
      name option is SASL_APPNAME.

      On success, SASL_OK is returned, and on failure a SASL C API error
      code is returned.  This function may be called a second time to
      change the global sasl_getopt_t callback used for new connections,
      but the first call must be made in a single-threaded environment.

      There must be a call to sasl_done for every successful call to
      sasl_server_init or sasl_client_init made. Each call to
      sasl_server_init or sasl_client_init increment the internal refer-
      ence counter. All but the last call to sasl_done descrement the
      counter, the final sasl_done does the actual cleanup.  The data
      referenced by the sasl_callback_t structure must persist until the
      very last call to sasl_done().

  3.5.2. sasl_server_new function

Arguments:
            IN const char *service,
            IN const char *serverFQDN,
            IN const char *user_realm,
            IN const char *iplocalport,
            IN const char *ipremoteport,
            IN const sasl_callback_t *callbacks,
            In unsigned int flags,
            OUT sasl_conn_t **pconn

Results:
            SASL_OK        -- success
            SASL_NOTINIT   -- SASL API not initialized
            SASL_BADPARAM  -- Invalid parameter supplied
            SASL_NOMECH    -- No mechanisms available
            SASL_NOMEM     -- Not enough memory

      This function creates a server connection context variable.  As
      long as each thread uses its own connection context, the SASL C
      API is thread-safe.

      The service argument is an IANA registered GSSAPI service element
      as defined in section 1.1. It MUST NOT be NULL.

      The serverFQDN is the fully qualified name of the server. It
      SHOULD NOT be NULL. If it is NULL, the SASL library can default
      the value in the implementation defined manner, e.g. the library
      MAY use a value stored in a configuration file or the result of
      gethostname() or a similar call.

INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


      The user_realm specifies the default realm. A realm defines a set
      of users on the system for systems which support multiple user
      communities ("realms"). If user_realm is NULL, the value of
      serverFQDN is used as the default realm. (If serverFQDN is also
      NULL, it is assumed that it has the value defaulted as described
      above.)

      The iplocalport is the string with the server IPv4/IPv6 address,
      followed by ":" and than by the port number. The syntax of
      IPv4/IPv6 addresses is defined by IPv4address/IPv6address ABNF
      elements from [RFC 2373]. NULL may be used for iplocalport, but
      may result in mechanisms requiring IP address being unavailable.

      The ipremoteport is the string with the client IPv4/IPv6 address,
      followed by ":" and than by the port number. The syntax of
      IPv4/IPv6 addresses is defined by IPv4address/IPv6address ABNF
      elements from [RFC 2373]. NULL may be used for ipremoteport, but
      may result in mechanisms requiring IP address being unavailable.

      The callbacks argument is a set of server callbacks which may
      include a connection-specific sasl_getopt_t. If a connection-spe-
      cific sasl_getopt_t callback is specified in callbacks list, it
      will take precedence over the global sasl_getopt_t callback speci-
      fied in the last sasl_server_init() call.

      The flags argument represents server-supported security flags.
      The value is a bitmask. Currently, only two values are defined:
      SASL_SUCCESS_DATA and SASL_NEED_PROXY.

      The SASL_SUCCESS_DATA flag specifies that the server (and the pro-
      tocol) supports sending "additional data on success". This flag is
      used by the SASL library to decide whether it can pass the success
      data back along with SASL_OK, or if it must return SASL_CONTINUE
      and then wait for an empty client response before returning
      SASL_OK.

      Even if SASL_SUCCESS_DATA is specified, the server MUST check the
      serverout pointer it receives from sasl_server_step() to see if it
      non-null, because some mechs only have success data in certain
      cases (ie, SRP with SSF==0).

      The SASL_NEED_PROXY flag tells the SASL library that it must only
      select mechanisms that support proxy authorization.

      The pconn argument is set to point to the newly created connection
      context.

            const char *clientin,
            insigned int clientinlen,
            const char **serverout,
            unsigned int *serveroutlen

Results:
            SASL_CONTINUE  -- Another authentication step required
            SASL_OK        -- Authentication Complete
            SASL_NOTINIT   -- SASL API not initialized
            SASL_BADPARAM  -- Invalid parameter supplied
            SASL_BADPROT   -- Client protocol error
            SASL_NOMECH    -- Mechanism not supported
            SASL_NOVERIFY  -- User exists, but no verifier exists for
                              the mechanism
            SASL_TRANS     -- A password transition is needed to use mechanism

      This begins an authentication exchange and is called after the
      client sends the initial authentication command.  The mech argu-
      ment is the mechanism name the client is requesting.  If the
      client includes an optional initial-response, it is passed in the
      clientin and clientinlen fields.  Otherwise NULL and 0 are passed
      for those arguments. The serverout and serveroutlen are filled in
      with the server response, if any.  If SASL_CONTINUE is returned,
      the server will need to wait for another client message and call
      sasl_server_step.  If SASL_OK is returned, the authentication is
      completed successfully, although serverout may be supplied.

      <<...Does this work for the server side?...>> If sasl_server_start
      is called a second time using the same connection context, it will
      discard any cached information (e.g., the username and password)
      and restart the exchange as if this were the first call to the
      sasl_server_start.

            SASL_BADPARAM  -- Invalid parameter supplied
            SASL_BADPROT   -- Client protocol error
            SASL_NOVERIFY  -- User exists, but no verifier exists for
                              the mechanism
            SASL_TRANS     -- A password transition is needed to use mechanism

      This routine performs one step in an authentication sequence.

      The conn argument must be a connection context created by
      sasl_server_new and used in a previous call to sasl_server_start.

      The clientin and clientinlen parameters hold the SASL octet string
      received from the client.  Note that for those SASL profiles which
      base64 encode the exchange, this is the result after the removal
      of the base64 encoding (see the sasl_decode64 routine). The cli-
      entin may contain arbitrary binary data, in particular it MAY con-
      tain one or more NUL characters. The clientin MUST have a termi-
      nating NUL character not counted by serverinlen.

      The serverout and serveroutlen parameters hold the SASL octet
      string to encode (if necessary) and send to the client. If
      SASL_CONTINUE is returned, the server will need to wait for
      another client message and call sasl_server_step.  If SASL_OK is
      returned, the authentication is completed successfully, although
      server out data may be supplied.

 3.6.   Common SASL API Routines

      This section describes the routines that are common to both
      clients and servers.

  3.6.1. sasl_listmech function







Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 22]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t *conn,
            const char *user,
            const char *prefix,
            const char *sep,
            const char *suffix,
            char **result,
            unsigned int *plen,
            unsigned *pcount

Results:
            SASL_OK        -- Success
            SASL_NOMEM     -- Not enough memory
            SASL_NOMECH    -- No enabled mechanisms

      This returns a list of enabled SASL mechanisms in a NUL-terminated
      string.  The list is constructed by placing the prefix string at
      the beginning, placing the sep string between any pair of mecha-
      nisms and placing the suffix string at the end.

      When calling this function plen and pcount MAY be NULL.

      This function returns the list of the client side SASL mechanisms,
      if the conn was created by sasl_client_new and the list of the
      server side mechanisms, if the conn was created by
      sasl_server_new. The list returned by this function must persist
      till a next call to sasl_free_listmech or sasl_listmech.

  3.6.2. sasl_free_listmech function

Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t *conn,
            char **result

Results:
            none

      This disposes of the result string returned by sasl_listmech.

  3.6.3. sasl_setprop function











Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 23]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t *conn,
            int propnum,
            const void *value

Results:
            SASL_OK          -- property set
            SASL_BADPARAM    -- invalid propnum or value or connection is NULL
            SASL_BADPROT     -- the property is not settable for this type of connection
            SASL_NOMEM       -- not enough memory to perform operation

      This sets a property in a connection context. Commonly used prop-
      erties with their descriptions are listed below:

      SASL_SSF_EXTERNAL

      Security layer strength factor (SSF) -- an unsigned integer usable
      by the caller to specify approximate security layer strength
      desired. It roughly corresponds to the effective key length for
      encryption, e.g.
       0   = no protection
       1   = integrity protection only >1   = key lenght of the cipher

      SASL_SSF_EXTERNAL property denotes SSF of the external security
      layer (e.g.  provided by TLS). The value parameter points to
      sasl_ssf_t, that is described as follows:

      typedef unsigned sasl_ssf_t;



      SASL_SEC_PROPS

      The value parameter for SASL_SEC_PROPS points to sasl_secu-
      rity_properties_t structure defined below. A particular implemen-
      tation may extend it with additional fields.

      typedef struct sasl_security_properties
      {
          sasl_ssf_t min_ssf;
          sasl_ssf_t max_ssf;

          unsigned maxbufsize;

          /* bitfield for attacks to protect against */
          unsigned security_flags;
      } sasl_security_properties_t;




Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 24]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


      The min_ssf and the max_ssf define the minimal and the maximal
      acceptable SSF.

      The maxbufsize specifies the biggest buffer size that the
      client/server is able to decode. 0 means that security layer is
      not supported.

      The security_flags is a bitmask of the various security flags
      described below:

       SASL_SEC_NOPLAINTEXT          -- don't permit mechanisms susceptible to simple
                                        passive attack (e.g., PLAIN, LOGIN)
       SASL_SEC_NOACTIVE             -- protection from active (non-dictionary) attacks
                                        during authentication exchange.
                                        Authenticates server.
       SASL_SEC_NODICTIONARY         -- don't permit mechanisms susceptible to passive
                                        dictionary attack
       SASL_SEC_FORWARD_SECRECY      -- require forward secrecy between sessions
                                        (breaking one won't help break next)
       SASL_SEC_NOANONYMOUS          -- don't permit mechanisms that allow anonymous login
       SASL_SEC_PASS_CREDENTIALS     -- require mechanisms which pass client
                                        credentials, and allow mechanisms which can pass
                                        credentials to do so
       SASL_SEC_MUTUAL_AUTH          -- require mechanisms which provide mutual
                                        authentication

      SASL_AUTH_EXTERNAL

      The value parameter for SASL_AUTH_EXTERNAL property points to the
      external authentication ID as provided by external authentication
      method, e.g. TLS, PPP or IPSec.

      Full list of properties is provided in section 6.

  3.6.4. sasl_getprop function
















Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 25]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t *conn,
            int propnum,
            const void **pvalue

Results:
            SASL_OK        -- Success
            SASL_NOTDONE   -- Authentication exchange must complete prior to
                              retrieving this attribute
            SASL_BADPARAM  -- bad property number or invalid connection type
            SASL_BADPROT   -- the property is not readable for this type of connection

      This requests a pointer to a constant property available through
      the SASL API.  The most common use by servers is to get the
      SASL_USERNAME property which returns the authorization identity
      (user to login as) from the SASL mechanism as a UTF-8 string in
      the pvalue parameter.  Full list of properties is provided in sec-
      tion 6.

  3.6.5. sasl_dispose function

Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t **pconn

Results:
            none

      This function disposes of the connection state created with
      sasl_client_new or sasl_server_new, and sets the pointer to NULL.
      If the pconn is already NULL the function does nothing.

  3.6.6. sasl_done function

Arguments:
            none

Results:
            none

      A SASL application that is finished with the SASL API must call
      this function.  This function frees any memory allocated by the
      SASL library or any other library state. After this call most of
      the SASL API function will again return the SASL_NOTINIT error
      code.

      There must be a call to sasl_done for every successful call to
      sasl_server_init or sasl_client_init made. Only the final
      sasl_done does the actual cleanup; the preceding calls simply



Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 26]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


      decrement an internal reference count.

      Connection states MUST be disposed of with sasl_dispose before
      calling this function.

  3.6.7. sasl_version function

Arguments:
            const char **implementation,
            int *version

Results:
            none

      This function returns a string identifying a particular implemen-
      tation of the SASL C API (implementation parameter) and a vendor
      specific version number.  Both parameters are optional.

      The implementation string is not allocated and must not be freed.

4.     SASL Security Layer Routines

      This section describes the routines need to support a security
      layer.

 4.1. sasl_encode function

Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t *conn,
            const char *input,
            unsigned int inputlen,
            const char **output,
            unsigned int *outputlen

Results:
            SASL_OK        -- Success (returns input if no layer negotiated)
            SASL_NOTDONE   -- Security layer negotiation not finished
            SASL_BADPARAM  -- inputlen is greater than the SASL_MAXOUTBUF property

      This function encodes a block of data for transmission using secu-
      rity layer (if any). The output and outputlen are filled in with
      the encoded data and its length respectively. If there is no secu-
      rity layer the input buffer is returned in the output. Otherwise,
      the output is only valid until a next call to sasl_encode or
      sasl_dispose.

      Both sides of the connection should follow the following guide-
      lines



Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 27]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


        * Before starting authentication, the application should set
          the maxbufsize field in the sasl_security_properties_t
          to be the buffer size that the application passes to
          the read() system call, i.e. the amount of data that the
          application is prepared to read at any one time.
          After that the application should use sasl_setprop() with
          the property index of SASL_SEC_PROPS to notify SASL API
          about the choice.

        * After authentication finishes, the application should use
          sasl_getprop() to retrieve the SASL_MAXOUTBUF value, and call
          sasl_encode() with chunks of data of that size or less.
          sasl_encode() will throw an error if it is called
          with a larger chunk of data.

 4.2. sasl_decode function

Arguments:
            sasl_conn_t *conn,
            const char *input,
            unsigned int inputlen,
            const char **output,
            unsigned int *outputlen

Results:
            SASL_OK        -- Success (returns input if no layer negotiated)
            SASL_NOTDONE   -- Security layer negotiation not finished
            SASL_BADMAC    -- Bad message integrity check

      This function decodes a block of data received using security
      layer (if any). The output and outputlen are filled in with the
      decoded data and its length respectively. If there is no security
      layer the input buffer is returned in the output. Otherwise, the
      output is only valid until a next call to sasl_decode or sasl_dis-
      pose.

      If the input contains more than one SASL token, sasl_decode MUST
      concatenate the decoded data together. If the input contains one
      or more SASL tokens and a few bytes of a subsequent SASL token,
      sasl_decode MUST save the beginning of the uncomplete token in the
      conn and use the saved data when the sasl_decode is called the
      next time. Because all SASL mechanisms MUST negotiate or declare
      the maximal token size, preallocated buffer inside sasl_conn_t can
      be used for this.

5.     Advanced SASL API Routines

      This section describes the less frequently used functions



Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 28]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


      available in the SASL API.

 5.1.   Additional Initialization Routines

  5.1.1. sasl_set_mutex function

Arguments:
            sasl_mutex_alloc_t  *mutex_alloc,
            sasl_mutex_lock_t   *mutex_lock,
            sasl_mutex_unlock_t *mutex_unlock,
            sasl_mutex_free_t   *mutex_free

Results:
            None

      The sasl_set_mutex call sets the callbacks which the SASL API and
      plug-ins will use whenever exclusive access to a process shared
      resource is needed.  A single-threaded client or server need not
      call this.  The types are designed to be compatible with the LDAP
      API [LDAP-API]:

      typedef void *sasl_mutex_alloc_t(void);

      On success, this returns a pointer to an allocated and initialized
      mutex structure.  On failure, it returns NULL.

      typedef int sasl_mutex_lock_t(void *mutex);

      This will block the current thread until it is possible to get an
      exclusive lock on a mutex allocated by the mutex_alloc callback.
      On success it returns 0, on failure due to deadlock or bad parame-
      ter, it returns -1.

      typedef int sasl_mutex_unlock_t(void *mutex);

      This releases a lock on a mutex allocated by the mutex_alloc call-
      back.  On success it returns 0, on failure due to an already
      unlocked mutex, or bad parameter, it returns -1.

      typedef void sasl_mutex_free_t(void *mutex);

      This disposes of a mutex allocated by mutex_alloc.

  5.1.2. sasl_set_alloc function







Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 29]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


Arguments:
            sasl_malloc_t  *malloc,
            sasl_calloc_t  *calloc,
            sasl_realloc_t *realloc,
            sasl_free_t    *free

Results:
            None

      This sets the memory allocation functions which the SASL API will
      use.  The SASL API will use its own routines (usually the standard
      C library) if these are not set.

      typedef void *sasl_malloc_t(unsigned long mem_size);

      This allocates memory mem_size bytes of memory.  The memory is not
      initialized to any particular value.  It returns NULL on a fail-
      ure, or when mem_size is 0.

      typedef void *sasl_calloc_t(unsigned long elem_size,
                      unsigned long num_elem);

      This allocates elem_size * num_elem bytes of memory.  The memory
      is initialized to 0.  It returns NULL on a failure or when either
      elem_size and/or num_elem is 0.

      typedef void *sasl_realloc_t(void *mem_ptr, unsigned long
      new_size);

      This changes the size of a memory block previously allocated by
      malloc or calloc, and returns a pointer to the new location (which
      may be different from mem_ptr).  If mem_ptr is NULL, it is identi-
      cal to the malloc function.

      It returns NULL on a failure or when new_size is 0. On failure the
      original block is unchanged. When new_size is 0 the function works
      as the free function.

      typedef void sasl_free_t(void *mem_ptr);

      This releases the memory in mem_ptr that was allocated by the mal-
      loc or the calloc or resized by the realloc. If mem_ptr is NULL,
      the function does nothing and returns immediately. The contents of
      the memory may be altered by this call.

6.     Standard Properties

      r/o - read only



Newman et al.              Expires: March 2004         FORMFEED[Page 30]





INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


      r/w - read-write
      server - server side only

      SASL_USERNAME     -- (r/o) pointer to NUL terminated user name (authorization id)
      SASL_SSF          -- (r/o) security layer security strength factor,
                           if 0, call to sasl_encode, sasl_decode unnecessary
      SASL_MAXOUTBUF    -- (r/o) security layer maximal output buffer size, unsigned.
                           Use maxbufsize field in sasl_security_properties_t structure
                           (settable as SASL_SEC_PROPS property) to set required maximal
                           output buffer size before starting a SASL authentication.
                           The value returned by SASL_MAXOUTBUF may differ (be less) from
                           the value specified in maxbufsize field.
      SASL_DEFUSERREALM -- (r/w, server) default realm passed to sasl_server_new or set with
                           sasl_setprop
      SASL_GETOPTCTX    -- (r/o) context for getopt callback
      SASL_CALLBACK     -- (r/o) current callback function list
      SASL_IPLOCALPORT  -- (r/w) iplocalport string passed to sasl_server_new/
                           sasl_client_new or set with sasl_setprop.
      SASL_IPREMOTEPORT -- (r/w) ipremoteport string passed to sasl_server_new/
                           sasl_client_new or set with sasl_setprop.
      SASL_PLUGERR      -- (r/o) a string which is either empty or has an error message
                           from the sasl_seterror (e.g., from a plug-in or callback).
                           It differs from the result of sasl_errdetail() which also takes
                           into account the last return status code.
      SASL_SERVICE      -- (r/o) service passed to sasl_*_new
      SASL_SERVERFQDN   -- (r/o) serverFQDN passed to sasl_*_new
      SASL_AUTHSOURCE   -- (r/o) name of the active plugin, if any.
                           If the implementation of SASL API doesn't support plugins,
                           it SHOULD return the name of the active SASL mechanism (if any).
                           If no mechanism name is available, sasl_getprop should fail
                           with SASL_NOTDONE error code.
      SASL_MECHNAME     -- (r/o) active SASL mechanism name, if any
      SASL_AUTHUSER     -- (r/o) pointer to a NUL terminated authentication/admin user
                           (authentication id).
      SASL_APPNAME      -- (r/w) name of the calling application.
                           This name can be used for logging purposes and/or to construct
                           the name of the configuration file. This property is available
                           to both server and client applications.
                           When a server application specifies an non NULL appname parameter
                           in a call to sasl_server_init function, a SASL API implementation
                           MUST call sasl_setprop internally with the appname as the value

INTERNET DRAFT                 SASL C API                 September 2003


   The design goals of the SASL C API are as follows:


o   To be simple and practical to use.

o   To provide related utility services in addition to core SASL func-
    tionality.

o   To be reasonably extensible.

o   To be suitable for use in a multi-threaded server or client.

o   To avoid dependancies on a specific memory allocation system, thread
    package or network model.

o   To be an independent service rather than a new layer.
