INTERNET-DRAFT                  SASL YAP                25 February 2007


Abstract

  This document describes a password authentication mechanism, called
  YAP-SHA-256, for use in protocols support Simple Authentication and
  Security Layer (SASL) framework.  The mechanism relies on security
  services provided by a lower layer, such as Transport Layer Security
  (TLS), to protect the authentication exchange, and subsequent
  application data exchange, from common attacks.  The YAP-SHA-256
  mechanism may be viewed as an alternative to other password-based SASL
  mechanism, such as PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5.


1. Introduction

  There exists multiple password-based methods for use in the Simple
  Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [RFC4422] framework.  These
  include the PLAIN [RFC4616], CRAM-MD5 [RFC2195], and DIGEST-MD5
  [RFC2831].  None of these mechanisms, themselves, provide integrity
  and confidential protection over the entirety of the authentication
  exchange.  Only DIGEST-MD5 offers a security layer and, even so, the
  specification and implementations suffer from multiple problems.  And
  while these mechanisms may be used in conjunction with lower-level
  security services, these mechanism do not offer any facility to bind
  the channels [CBIND].

  This situation has lead to multiple efforts to design "better" SASL
  password-based mechanism.  This document not only specifies yet
  another password mechanism, YAP-SHA-256, but defines a family of
  related password mechanisms.

  The YAP is a family of simple password SASL mechanisms based upon the
  Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) [RFC2104] algorithm.
  The YAP-SHA-256 utilizes the SHA-256 [FIPS180-2] cryptographic hash
  function in conjunction with the HMAC algorithm.  YAP is specified as
  a family of SASL mechanisms to provide hash agility.

  YAP mechanisms reply on services provided at a lower level, such as
  Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC4346], to secure the authentication
  exchange and subsequent application data exchange and, hence,
  YAP-SHA-256 does not offer a SASL security layer.  YAP mechanisms
  requires the lower-level security layer to be bound [CBIND] in the
  authentication.

  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2. The YAP-* Family of mechanism

  Each mechanism in this family differs only by the choice of hash
  algorithm.  Each mechanism has a name of the form YAP-HASH where HASH
  is a string chosen to reflect the hash algorithm used.  To define a
  new mechanism within this family, the mechanism specification need
  only identify that it is a YAP mechanism, identify the hash algorithm
  used, and identify the name of the mechanism.  The name of the
  mechanism is to be registered as discussed in [RFC4422].

  The mechanism involves a single message from the client to the server.

      message = authcid separator [ authzid ] separator data
      separator = %x00

  where:
      - <authcid> is authentication identity, a simple user name
        [RFC4013], prepared using the SASLprep [RFC4013] and represented
        in UTF-8 [RFC3629],

      - <authzid>, when present, is the authorization identity in the
        form specified by the application protocol specification,
        represented in UTF-8 [RFC3629], and

      - <data> is Base64 [RFC4648] encoding of a Keyed-Hash Message
        Authentication Code (HMAC) [RFC2104] produced as described
        below.

  The mechanism-specific hash algorithm, such as SHA-256 [FIPS180-2], is
  used as the cryptographic hash function, H, in computing the HMAC.
  The secret key, K, is the unique channel bindings [CBIND] for the
  lower-level security protocol, padded with zero octets to the block
  size of the hash function.  Where the unique channel binding is longer
  than the block size of the hash function, K is hash of the unique
  channel bindings.  The text is the concatenation of the authcid, the
  authzid, and the hash of the concatenation of the authcid and user's
  password, a simple password [RFC4013], prepared using SASLprep
  [RFC4013], and represented in UTF-8 [RFC3629].  That is, the <data> is
  computed as illustrated by the following pseudo code.

    Base64( HMAC(
      K( Pad( LEN(ChannelBindings)>HashBlockSize
        ? H(ChannelBindings) : ChannelBindings ), 0, HashBlockSize),
      Concat( authcid, authzid,
        H( authcid, UTF-8( SASLprep( password ))))))

  The text encompasses all parameters of the exchange to ensure
  integrity of all parameters.

  The text includes a hash encompassing the password, instead of the
  password itself, to allow the server to store this hash instead of the
  password.  This hash also encompasses the authcid to make it harder to
  mount dictionary attacks using pre-computed dictionary entries.

  Implementations SHOULD NOT advertise availabilty of any mechanism in
  this family unless a lower-level security service provding both data
  integrity and data confidentiality protection is in place.  Client
  implementations SHOULD NOT utilize any mechanism in this family
  without first verifying the identity of the server within the
  lower-level security service.  Client implementors should consult the
  application protocol specification, in conjuction with the
  specification of the lower-level security service, for details on how
  to implement this verification.

  Implementations MUST support Transport Security Layer (TLS) [RFC4346]
  channel bindings, as describe in [CBIND-TLS].


  3. The YAP-SHA256 Mechanism

  The YAP-SHA-256 mechanism, named "YAP-SHA-256", is a YAP SASL
  mechanism.  The YAP-SHA-256 mechanism, as the name suggests, uses the
  SHA-256 [FIPS180-2][RFC4634] hash algorithm.


4. Security Considerations

  Security is discussed throughout this document.

  This family of mechanisms was specifically designed to reply on
  security services offered at lower-levels to secure the authentication
  exchange and subsequent data exchanges.  To ensure lower-level
  security services are provided end-to-end, the mechanisms utilize
  channel bindings [CBIND].

  To avoid disclosing the identity information to a rogue server, the
  client is to verify the server's identity using the lower-layer
  security service before utilizing any mechanism in this family.

  Hash agility is provided in the family of mechanisms through the
  specification of additional mechanisms.
