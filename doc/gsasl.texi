@chapter Introduction

This manual can be used in several ways.  If read from the beginning
to the end, it gives the reader an understanding of the SASL framework
and the GNU SASL implementation, and how the GNU SASL library is used
in an application.  Forward references are included where necessary.
Later on, the manual can be used as a reference manual to get just the
information needed about any particular interface of the library.
Experienced programmers might want to start looking at the examples at
the end of the manual, and then only read up those parts of the
interface which are unclear.

@node SASL Overview
@section SASL Overview

SASL is a framework for application protocols, such as SMTP or IMAP,
to add authentication support.  For example, SASL is used to prove to
the server who you are when you access an IMAP server to read your
e-mail.

The SASL framework does not specify the technology used to perform the
authentication, that is the responsibility for each SASL mechanism.
Popular SASL mechanisms include CRAM-MD5 and GSSAPI (for Kerberos V5).

Typically a SASL negotiation works as follows.  First the client
requests authentication (possibly implicitly by connecting to the
server).  The server responds with a list of supported mechanisms.
The client chose one of the mechanisms.  The client and server then
exchange data, one round-trip at a time, until authentication either
succeeds or fails.  After that, the client and server knows more about
who is on the other end of the channel.

For example, in SMTP communication happens like this:

@smallexample
250-mail.example.com Hello pc.example.org [192.168.1.42], pleased to meet you
250-AUTH DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 LOGIN PLAIN
250 HELP
AUTH CRAM-MD5
334 PDk5MDgwNDEzMDUwNTUyMTE1NDQ5LjBAbG9jYWxob3N0Pg==
amFzIDBkZDRkODZkMDVjNjI4ODRkYzc3OTcwODE4ZGI5MGY3
235 2.0.0 OK Authenticated
@end smallexample

Here the first three lines are sent by the server and contains the
list of supported mechanisms (DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, etc).  The next
line is sent by the client to select the CRAM-MD5 mechanism.  The
server replies with a challenge, which is a message that can be
generated by calling GNU SASL functions.  The client replies with a
response, which also is a message that can be generated by GNU SASL
functions.  Depending on the mechanism, there can be more than one
round trip, so do not assume all authentication exchanges consists of
one message from the server and one from the client.  The server
accepts the authentication.  At that point it knows it is talking to a
authenticated client, and the application protocol can continue.

Essentially, your application is responsible for implementing the
framing protocol (e.g., SMTP or XMPP) according to the particular
specifications.  Your application uses GNU SASL to generate the
authentication messages.

@node Implementation
@section Implementation

GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms.

GNU SASL consists of a library (@code{libgsasl}), a command line
utility (@code{gsasl}) to access the library from the shell, and a
manual.  The library includes support for the framework (with
authentication functions and application data privacy and integrity
functions) and at least partial support for the ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5,
DIGEST-MD5, EXTERNAL, GS2-KRB5, GSSAPI, LOGIN, NTLM, PLAIN,
SCRAM-SHA-1 (and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS), and SECURID mechanisms.

The library is easily ported because it does not do network
communication by itself, but rather leaves it up to the calling
application.  The library is flexible with regards to the
authorization infrastructure used, as it utilizes a callback into the
application to decide whether a user is authorized or not.

GNU SASL is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows, and many
kind of devices including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.

GNU SASL is written in pure ANSI C89 to be portable to embedded and
otherwise limited platforms.  The entire library, with full support
for ANONYMOUS, EXTERNAL, PLAIN, LOGIN and CRAM-MD5, and the front-end
that supports client and server mode, and the IMAP and SMTP protocols,
fits in under 80kb on an Intel x86 platform, without any modifications
to the code.  (This figure was accurate as of version 1.1.)

The design of the library and the intended interaction between
applications and the library through the official API is illustrated
below.

@node Features
@section Features

GNU SASL might have a couple of advantages over other libraries doing
a similar job.

@table @asis
@item It's Free Software
Anybody can use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License version 3.0 or later.  The library uses the
GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later.

@item It's thread-safe
No global variables are used and multiple library handles and session
handles may be used in parallel.

@item It's internationalized
It handles non-ASCII usernames and passwords and user visible strings
used in the library (error messages) can be translated into the users'
language.

@item It's portable
It should work on all Unix like operating systems, including Windows.
The library itself should be portable to any C89 system, not even
POSIX is required.

@item It's small
The library has been rewritten with embedded platforms in mind.  For
example, no API consumes more than around 250 bytes of stack space.

@end table

Note that the library does not implement any policy to decide whether
a certain user is ``authenticated'' or ``authorized'' or not.  Rather,
it uses a callback into the application to answer these questions.

@node Requirements
@section Requirements

The GNU SASL library does not have any required external dependencies,
but some optional features are enabled if you have a specific external
library.

@table @asis
@item LibNTLM
The NTLM mechanism requires the library LibNTLM,
@url{http://www.nongnu.org/libntlm/}.

@item GSS-API
The GSSAPI and GS2-KRB5 mechanisms requires a GSS-API library, see GNU
GSS (@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gss/}).  MIT Kerberos or Heimdal
are also supported.

@item LibIDN
Processing of non-ASCII usernames and passwords requires the SASLprep
implementation in LibIDN (@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/}).
This is needed for full conformance with the latest SASL protocol
drafts, but is optional in the library for improved portability.

@item Libgcrypt
The GNU SASL library ships with its own cryptographic implementation,
but it can use the one in libgcrypt (@url{http://www.gnupg.org/})
instead, if it is available.  This is typically useful for desktop
machines which have libgcrypt installed.
@end table

The command-line interface to GNU SASL requires a POSIX or Windows
platform for network connectivity.  The command-line tool can make use
of GnuTLS (@url{http://www.gnutls.org/}) to support the STARTTLS modes
of IMAP and SMTP, but GnuTLS is not required.

Note that the library does not need a POSIX platform or network
connectivity.

@node Downloading and Installing
@section Downloading and Installing
@cindex Installation
@cindex Download

The package can be downloaded from several places, including:

@url{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsasl/}

The latest version is stored in a file, e.g.,
@samp{gsasl-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz} where the @samp{@value{VERSION}}
value is the highest version number in the directory.

The package is then extracted, configured and built like many other
packages that use Autoconf.  For detailed information on configuring
and building it, refer to the @file{INSTALL} file that is part of the
distribution archive.

Here is an example terminal session that downloads, configures, builds
and install the package.  You will need a few basic tools, such as
@samp{sh}, @samp{make} and @samp{cc}.

@example
$ wget -q ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsasl/gsasl-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
$ tar xfz gsasl-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
$ cd gsasl-@value{VERSION}/
$ ./configure
...
$ make
...
$ make install
...
@end example

After that gsasl should be properly installed and ready for use.

A few @code{configure} options may be relevant, summarized in the
table.

@table @code

@item --disable-client
@itemx --disable-server
If your target system require a minimal implementation, you may wish
to disable the client or the server part of the code.  This does not
remove symbols from the library, so if you attempt to call an
application that uses server functions in a library built with
@code{--disable-server}, the function will return an error code.

@item --disable-obsolete
Remove backwards compatibility (@pxref{Old Functions}).  Use if you
want to limit the size of the library.

@item --disable-anonymous
@itemx --disable-external
@itemx --disable-plain
@itemx --disable-login
@itemx --disable-securid
@itemx --disable-ntlm
@itemx --disable-cram-md5
@itemx --disable-digest-md5
@itemx --disable-gssapi
@itemx --disable-gs2
@itemx --enable-kerberos_v5
@itemx --disable-scram-sha1
Disable or enable individual mechanisms (@pxref{Mechanisms}).

@item --without-stringprep
Disable internationalized string processing.  Note that this will
result in a SASL library that is only compatible with RFC 2222.

@node Installing under Windows
@subsection Installing under Windows

There are two ways to build GNU SASL on Windows: via MinGW or via
Microsoft Visual Studio.  Note that a binary release for Windows is
available from @url{http://josefsson.org/gnutls4win/}.

With MinGW, you can build a GNU SASL DLL and use it from other
applications.  After installing MinGW (@url{http://mingw.org/}) follow
the generic installation instructions (@pxref{Downloading and
Installing}).  The DLL is installed by default.

For information on how to use the DLL in other applications, see:
@url{http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml#faq-msvcdll}.

You can build GNU SASL as a native Visual Studio C++ project.  This
allows you to build the code for other platforms that VS supports,
such as Windows Mobile.  You need Visual Studio 2005 or later.

First download and unpack the archive as described in the generic
installation instructions (@pxref{Downloading and Installing}).  Don't
run @code{./configure}.  Instead, start Visual Studio and open the
project file @file{lib/win32/libgsasl.sln} inside the GNU SASL
directory.  You should be able to build the project using Build
Project.

Output libraries will be written into the @code{lib/win32/lib} (or
@code{lib/win32/lib/debug} for Debug versions) folder.

Warning!  Unless you build GNU SASL linked with libgcrypt, GNU SASL
uses the Windows function @code{CryptGenRandom} for generating
cryptographic random data.  The function is known to have some
security weaknesses.  See @url{http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/419} for
more information.  The code will attempt to use the Intel RND crypto
provider if it is installed, see @file{lib/gl/gc-gnulib.c}.

@node Kerberos on Windows
@subsection Kerberos on Windows

Building GNU SASL with support for Kerberos via GSS-API on Windows is
straight forward if you use GNU GSS and GNU Shishi as the Kerberos
implementation.

If you are using MIT Kerberos for Windows (KfW), getting GNU SASL to
build with Kerberos support is not straightforward because KfW does
not follow the GNU coding style and it has bugs that needs to be
worked around.  We provide instructions for this environment as well,
in the hope that it will be useful for GNU SASL users.

Our instructions assumes you are building the software on a dpkg-based
GNU/Linux systems (e.g., gNewSense) using the MinGW cross-compiler
suite.  These instructions were compiled for KfW version 3.2.2 which
were the latest as of 2010-09-25.

We assume that you have installed a normal build environment including
the MinGW cross-compiler.  Download and unpack the KfW SDK like this:

@example
$ mkdir ~/kfw
$ cd ~/kfw
$ wget -q http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/kfw/3.2/kfw-3.2.2/kfw-3-2-2-sdk.zip
$ unzip kfw-3-2-2-sdk.zip
@end example

Fix a bug in the "win-mac.h" header inside KfW by replacing
@code{#include <sys\foo.h>} with @code{#include <sys/foo.h>}:

@example
perl -pi -e 's,sys\\,sys/,' ~/kfw/kfw-3-2-2-final/inc/krb5/win-mac.h
@end example

Unpack your copy of GNU SASL:

@example
$ wget -q ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gsasl/gsasl-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
$ tar xfz gsasl-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
$ cd gsasl-@value{VERSION}
@end example

Configure GNU SASL like this:

@example
$ lt_cv_deplibs_check_method=pass_all ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu --with-gssapi-impl=kfw LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/kfw/kfw-3-2-2-final/lib/i386" CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/kfw/kfw-3-2-2-final/inc/krb5 -DSSIZE_T_DEFINED"
@end example

The 'lt_cv_deplibs_check_method=pass_all' setting is required because
the KfW SDK does not ship with Libtool @code{*.la} files and is using
non-standard DLL names.  The @code{-DSSIZE_T_DEFINED} is necessary
because the @code{win-mac.h} file would provide an incorrect duplicate
definitions of @code{ssize_t} otherwise.  By passing
@code{--with-gssapi-impl=kfw} you activate other bug workarounds, such
as providing a @code{GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE} symbol.

Build the software using:

@example
$ make
@end example

If you have Wine installed and your kernel is able to invoke it
automatically for Windows programs, you can run the self tests.  This
is recommended to make sure the build is sane.

@example
$ make check
@end example

You may get error messages about missing DLLs, like this error:

@example
err:module:import_dll Library gssapi32.dll (which is needed by L"Z:\\home\\jas\\src\\gsasl-1.5.2\\lib\\src\\.libs\\libgsasl-7.dll") not found
@end example

If that happens, you need to make sure that Wine can find the
appropriate DLL.  The simplest solution is to copy the necessary DLLs
to @code{~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32/}.

You may now copy the following files onto the Windows machine (e.g.,
through a USB memory device):

@example
lib/src/.libs/libgsasl-7.dll
src/.libs/gsasl.exe
@end example

The remaining steps are done on the Windows XP machine.  Install KfW
and configure it for your realm.  To make sure KfW is working
properly, acquire a user ticket and then remove it.  For testing
purposes, you may use the realm 'interop.josefsson.org' with KDC
'interop.josefsson.org' and username 'user' and password 'pass'.

Change to the directory where you placed the files above, and invoke a
command like this:

@example
gsasl.exe -d interop.josefsson.org
@end example

KfW should query you for a password, and the tool should negotiate
authentication against the server using GS2-KRB5.

If you want to submit a patch for inclusion -- from solve a typo you
discovered, up to adding support for a new feature -- you should
submit it as a bug report (@pxref{Bug Reports}).  There are some
things that you can do to increase the chances for it to be included
in the official package.

Unless your patch is very small (say, under 10 lines) we require that
you assign the copyright of your work to the Free Software Foundation.
This is to protect the freedom of the project.  If you have not
already signed papers, we will send you the necessary information when
you submit your contribution.

For contributions that doesn't consist of actual programming code, the
only guidelines are common sense.  Use it.

For code contributions, a number of style guides will help you:

@itemize @bullet

@item Coding Style.
Follow the GNU Standards document (@pxref{top, GNU Coding Standards,,
standards}).

If you normally code using another coding standard, there is no
problem, but you should use @samp{indent} to reformat the code
(@pxref{top, GNU Indent,, indent}) before submitting your work.

@item Use the unified diff format @samp{diff -u}.

@item Return errors.
No reason whatsoever should abort the execution of the library.  Even
memory allocation errors, e.g. when @code{malloc} return @code{NULL},
should work although result in an error code.

@item Design with thread safety in mind.
Don't use global variables.  Don't even write to per-handle global
variables unless the documented behaviour of the function you write is
to write to the per-handle global variable.

@item Avoid using the C math library.
It causes problems for embedded implementations, and in most
situations it is very easy to avoid using it.

@item Document your functions.
Use comments before each function headers, that, if properly
formatted, are extracted into Texinfo manuals and GTK-DOC web pages.

@item Supply a ChangeLog and NEWS entries, where appropriate.

To use GNU SASL, you have to perform some changes to your sources and
the build system.  The necessary changes are small and explained in
the following sections.  At the end of this chapter, it is described
how the library is initialized, and how the requirements of the
library are verified.

A faster way to find out how to adapt your application for use with
GNU SASL may be to look at the examples at the end of this manual
(@pxref{Examples}).

@node Header
@section Header

All interfaces (data types and functions) of the library are defined
in the header file @code{gsasl.h}.  You must include this in all
programs using the library, either directly or through some other
header file, like this:

@example
#include <gsasl.h>
@end example

The name space is @code{gsasl_*} for function names, @code{Gsasl*} for
data types and @code{GSASL_*} for other symbols.  In addition the same
name prefixes with one prepended underscore are reserved for internal
use and should never be used by an application.

@node Initialization
@section Initialization

The library must be initialized before it can be used.  The library is
initialized by calling @code{gsasl_init} (@pxref{Global Functions}).
The resources allocated by the initialization process can be released
if the application no longer has a need to call `Libgsasl' functions,
this is done by calling @code{gsasl_done}.  For example:

@example
int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
@{
  Gsasl *ctx = NULL;
  int rc;
...
  rc = gsasl_init (&ctx);
  if (rc != GSASL_OK)
    @{
      printf ("SASL initialization failure (%d): %s\n",
              rc, gsasl_strerror (rc));
      return 1;
    @}
...
@end example

In order to make error messages from @code{gsasl_strerror} be
translated (@pxref{Top,,,gettext,GNU Gettext}) the application must
set the current locale using @code{setlocale} before calling
@code{gsasl_init}.  For example:

@example
int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
@{
  Gsasl *ctx = NULL;
  int rc;
...
  setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
...
  rc = gsasl_init (&ctx);
  if (rc != GSASL_OK)
    @{
      printf (gettext ("SASL initialization failure (%d): %s\n"),
              rc, gsasl_strerror (rc));
      return 1;
    @}
...
@end example

In order to take advantage of the secure memory features in
Libgcrypt@footnote{Note that GNU SASL normally use its own internal
implementation of the cryptographic functions.  Take care to verify
that GNU SASL really use Libgcrypt, if this is what you want.}, you
need to initialize secure memory in your application, and for some
platforms even make your application setuid root.  See the Libgcrypt
documentation for more information.  Here is example code to
initialize secure memory in your code:

@example
#include <gcrypt.h>
...
int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
@{
  Gsasl *ctx = NULL;
  int rc;
...
  /* Check version of libgcrypt. */
  if (!gcry_check_version (GCRYPT_VERSION))
    die ("version mismatch\n");

  /* Allocate a pool of 16k secure memory.  This also drops priviliges
     on some systems. */
  gcry_control (GCRYCTL_INIT_SECMEM, 16384, 0);

  /* Tell Libgcrypt that initialization has completed. */
  gcry_control (GCRYCTL_INITIALIZATION_FINISHED, 0);
...
  rc = gsasl_init (&ctx);
  if (rc != GSASL_OK)
    @{
      printf ("SASL initialization failure (%d): %s\n",
              rc, gsasl_strerror (rc));
      return 1;
    @}
...
@end example

If you do not do this, keying material will not be allocated in secure
memory (which, for most applications, is not the biggest secure
problem anyway).  Note that the GNU SASL Library has not been audited
to make sure it stores passwords or keys in secure memory.

@node Version Check
@section Version Check

It is often desirable to check that the version of the library used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary
compatibility, new features may have been introduced but, due to
problem with the dynamic linker, an old version may actually be used.
So you may want to check that the version is okay right after program
startup.

@include texi/gsasl_check_version.texi

The normal way to use the function is to put something similar to the
following early in your @code{main}:

@example
  if (!gsasl_check_version (GSASL_VERSION))
    @{
      printf ("gsasl_check_version failed:\n"
              "Header file incompatible with shared library.\n");
      exit(1);
    @}
@end example

@node Building the source
@section Building the source
@cindex Compiling your application

If you want to compile a source file including the @file{gsasl.h}
header file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the @option{-I} option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, the library uses the
external package @command{pkg-config} that knows the path to the
include file and other configuration options.  The options that need
to be added to the compiler invocation at compile time are output by
the @option{--cflags} option to @command{pkg-config libgsasl}.  The
following example shows how it can be used at the command line:

@example
gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config libgsasl --cflags`
@end example

Adding the output of @samp{pkg-config libgsasl --cflags} to the
compiler command line will ensure that the compiler can find the
@file{gsasl.h} header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search
path (via the @option{-L} option).  For this, the option
@option{--libs} to @command{pkg-config libgsasl} can be used.  For
convenience, this option also outputs all other options that are
required to link the program with the library (for instance, the
@samp{-lidn} option).  The example shows how to link @file{foo.o} with
the library to a program @command{foo}.

@example
gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config libgsasl --libs`
@end example

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to @command{pkg-config}:

@example
gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config libgsasl --cflags --libs`
@end example

@node Autoconf tests
@section Autoconf tests
@cindex Autoconf tests
@cindex Configure tests

If you work on a project that uses Autoconf (@pxref{top, GNU
Autoconf,, autoconf}) to help find installed libraries, the
suggestions in the previous section are not the entire story.  There
are a few methods to detect and incorporate the GNU SASL Library into
your Autoconf based package.  The preferred approach, is to use
Libtool in your project, and use the normal Autoconf header file and
library tests.

@subsection Autoconf test via @samp{pkg-config}

If your audience is a typical GNU/Linux desktop, you can often assume
they have the @samp{pkg-config} tool installed, in which you can use
its Autoconf M4 macro to find and set up your package for use with
Libgsasl.  The following example illustrates this scenario.

@example
AC_ARG_ENABLE(gsasl,
  AC_HELP_STRING([--disable-gsasl], [don't use GNU SASL]),
  gsasl=$enableval)
if test "$gsal" != "no" ; then
  PKG_CHECK_MODULES(GSASL, libgsasl >= @value{VERSION},
    [gsasl=yes],
    [gsasl=no])
  if test "$gsasl" != "yes" ; then
    gsasl=no
    AC_MSG_WARN([Cannot find GNU SASL, disabling])
  else
    gsasl=yes
    AC_DEFINE(USE_GSASL, 1, [Define to 1 if you want GNU SASL.])
  fi
fi
AC_MSG_CHECKING([if GNU SASL should be used])
AC_MSG_RESULT($gsasl)
@end example

@subsection Standalone Autoconf test using Libtool

If your package uses Libtool (@pxref{top, GNU Libtool,, libtool}), you
can use the normal Autoconf tests to find Libgsasl and rely on the
Libtool dependency tracking to include the proper dependency libraries
(e.g., Libidn).  The following example illustrates this scenario.

@example
AC_CHECK_HEADER(gsasl.h,
  AC_CHECK_LIB(gsasl, gsasl_check_version,
    [gsasl=yes AC_SUBST(GSASL_LIBS, -lgsasl)],
    gsasl=no),
  gsasl=no)
AC_ARG_ENABLE(gsasl,
  AC_HELP_STRING([--disable-gsasl], [don't use GNU SASL]),
  gsasl=$enableval)
if test "$gsasl" != "no" ; then
  AC_DEFINE(USE_SASL, 1, [Define to 1 if you want GNU SASL.])
else
  AC_MSG_WARN([Cannot find GNU SASL, diabling])
fi
AC_MSG_CHECKING([if GNU SASL should be used])
AC_MSG_RESULT($gsasl)
@end example

@chapter Using the Library
@cindex Overview
@cindex Library Overview

Your application's use of the library can be roughly modeled into the
following steps: initialize the library, optionally specify the
callback, perform the authentication, and finally clean up.  The
following image illustrates this.

@image{controlflow,15cm,5cm}

The third step may look complex, but for a simple client it will
actually not involve any code.  If your application needs to handle
several concurrent clients, or if it is a server that needs to serve
many clients simultaneous, things do get a bit more complicated.

For illustration, we will write a simple client.  Writing a server
would be similar, the only difference is that, later on, instead of
supplying a username and password, you need to decide whether someone
should be allowed to log in or not.  The code for what we have
discussed so far make up the @code{main} function in our client
(@pxref{Example 1}):

@example
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
@{
  Gsasl *ctx = NULL;
  int rc;

  if ((rc = gsasl_init (&ctx)) != GSASL_OK)
    @{
      printf ("Cannot initialize libgsasl (%d): %s",
              rc, gsasl_strerror (rc));
      return 1;
    @}

  client (ctx);

  gsasl_done (ctx);

  return 0;
@}
@end example

Here, the call to the function @code{client} correspond to the third
step in the image above.

For a more complicated application, having several clients running
simultaneous, instead of a simple call to @code{client}, it may have
created new threads for each session, and call @code{client} within
each thread.  The library is thread safe.

An actual authentication session is more complicated than what we have
seen so far.  These are the steps: decide which mechanism to use,
start the session, optionally specify the callback, optionally set any
properties, perform the authentication loop, and clean up.  Naturally,
your application will start to talk its own protocol (e.g., SMTP or
IMAP) after these steps have concluded.

The authentication loop is based on sending tokens (typically short
messages encoded in base 64) back and forth between the client and
server.  It continues until authentication succeeds or an error
occurs.  The format of the data to be transferred, the number of
iterations in the loop, and other details are specified by each
mechanism.  The goal of the library is to isolate your application
from the details of all different mechanisms.

Note that the library does not send data to the server itself, but
returns it in an buffer.  You must send it to the server, following an
application protocol profile.  For example, the SASL application
protocol profile for SMTP is described in RFC 2554.

The following image illustrates the steps we have been talking about.

@image{controlflow2,16cm,12cm}

We will now show the implementation of the @code{client} function used
before.

@example
void client (Gsasl *ctx)
@{
  Gsasl_session *session;
  const char *mech = "PLAIN";
  int rc;

  /* Create new authentication session. */
  if ((rc = gsasl_client_start (ctx, mech, &session)) != GSASL_OK)
    @{
      printf ("Cannot initialize client (%d): %s\n",
              rc, gsasl_strerror (rc));
      return;
    @}

  /* Set username and password in session handle.  This info will be
     lost when this session is deallocated below.  */
  gsasl_property_set (session, GSASL_AUTHID, "jas");
  gsasl_property_set (session, GSASL_PASSWORD, "secret");

  /* Do it. */
  client_authenticate (session);

  /* Cleanup. */
  gsasl_finish (session);
@}
@end example

This function is responsible for deciding which mechanism to use.  In
this case, the @samp{PLAIN} mechanism is hard coded, but you will see
later how this can be made more flexible.  The function creates a new
session, then it stores the username and password in the session
handle, then it calls another function @code{client_authenticate} to
handle the authentication loop, and finally it cleans up up.  Let's
continue with the implementation of @code{client_authenticate}.

@example
void client_authenticate (Gsasl_session * session)
@{
  char buf[BUFSIZ] = "";
  char *p;
  int rc;

  /* This loop mimics a protocol where the server sends data
     first. */

  do
    @{
      printf ("Input base64 encoded data from server:\n");
      fgets (buf, sizeof (buf) - 1, stdin);
      if (buf[strlen (buf) - 1] == '\n')
        buf[strlen (buf) - 1] = '\0';

      rc = gsasl_step64 (session, buf, &p);

      if (rc == GSASL_NEEDS_MORE || rc == GSASL_OK)
        @{
          printf ("Output:\n%s\n", p);
          free (p);
        @}
    @}
  while (rc == GSASL_NEEDS_MORE);

  printf ("\n");

  if (rc != GSASL_OK)
    @{
      printf ("Authentication error (%d): %s\n",
              rc, gsasl_strerror (rc));
      return;
    @}

  /* The client is done.  Here you would typically check if the
     server let the client in.  If not, you could try again. */

  printf ("If server accepted us, we're done.\n");
@}
@end example

This last function needs to be discussed in some detail.  First, you
should be aware that there are two versions of this function, that
differ in a subtle way.  The version above (@pxref{Example 2}) is used
for application profiles where the server sends data first.  For some
mechanisms, this may waste a roundtrip, because the server needs input
from the client to proceed.  Therefor, today the recommended approach
is to permit client to send data first (@pxref{Example 1}).  Which
version you should use depends on which application protocol you are
implementing.

Further, you should realize that it is bad programming style to use a
fixed size buffer.  On GNU systems, you may use the @code{getline}
functions instead of @code{fgets}.  However, in practice, there are
few mechanisms that use very large tokens.  In typical configurations,
the mechanism with the largest tokens (GSSAPI) can use at least 500
bytes.  A fixed buffer size of 8192 bytes may thus be sufficient for
now.  But don't say I didn't warn you, when a future mechanism doesn't
work in your application, because of a fixed size buffer.

The function @code{gsasl_step64} (and of course also @code{gasl_step})
returns two non-error return codes.  @code{GSASL_OK} is used for
success, indicating that the library considers the authentication
finished.  That may include a successful server authentication,
depending on the mechanism.  You must not let the client continue to
the application protocol part unless you receive @code{GSASL_OK} from
these functions.  In particular, don't be fooled into believing
authentication were successful if the server replies ``OK'' but these
functions have failed with an error.  The server may have been hacked,
and could be tricking you into sending confidential data, without
having successfully authenticated the server.

The non-error return code @code{GSASL_NEEDS_MORE} is used to signal to
your application that you should send the output token to the peer,
and wait for a new token, and do another iteration.  If the server
concludes the authentication process, with no data, you should call
@code{gsasl_step64} (or @code{gsasl_step}) specifying a zero-length
token.

If the functions (@code{gsasl_step} and @code{gsasl_step64}) return
any non-error code, the content of the output buffer is undefined.
Otherwise, it is the callers responsibility to deallocate the buffer,
by calling @code{free}.  Note that in some situations, where the
buffer is empty, @code{NULL} is returned as the buffer value.  You
should treat this as an empty buffer.

@section Choosing a mechanism

Our earlier code was hard coded to use a specific mechanism.  This is
rarely a good idea.  Instead, it is recommended to select the best
mechanism available from the list of mechanisms supported by the
server.  Note that without TLS or similar, the list may have been
maliciously altered, by an attacker.  This means that you should abort
if you cannot find any mechanism that exceeds your minimum security
level.  There is a function @code{gsasl_client_suggest_mechanism}
(@pxref{Global Functions}) that will try to pick the ``best''
available mechanism from a list of mechanisms.  Our simple interactive
example client (@pxref{Example 3}) includes the following function to
decide which mechanism to use.  Note that the code doesn't blindly use
what is returned from @code{gsasl_client_suggest_mechanism}, rather it
lets some logic (in this case the user, through an interactive query)
decide which mechanism is acceptable.

@example
const char *client_mechanism (Gsasl *ctx)
@{
  static char mech[GSASL_MAX_MECHANISM_SIZE + 1] = "";
  char mechlist[BUFSIZ] = "";
  const char *suggestion;

  printf ("Enter list of server supported mechanisms, separate by SPC:\n");
  fgets (mechlist, sizeof (mechlist) - 1, stdin);

  suggestion = gsasl_client_suggest_mechanism (ctx, mechlist);
  if (suggestion)
    printf ("Library suggests use of `%s'.\n", suggestion);

  printf ("Enter mechanism to use:\n");
  fgets (mech, sizeof (mech) - 1, stdin);
  mech[strlen (mech) - 1] = '\0';

  return mech;
@}
@end example

When running this example code, it might look like in the following
output.

@example
Enter list server supported mechanisms, separate by SPC:
CRAM-MD5 DIGEST-MD5 GSSAPI FOO BAR
Library suggests use of `GSSAPI'.
Enter mechanism to use:
CRAM-MD5
Input base64 encoded data from server:
Zm5vcmQ=
Output:
amFzIDkyY2U1NWE5MTM2ZTY4NzEyMTUyZTFjYmFmNjVkZjgx

If server accepted us, we're done.
@end example

@section Using a callback

Our earlier code specified the username and password before the
authentication loop, as in:

@example
gsasl_property_set (ctx, GSASL_AUTHID, "jas");
gsasl_property_set (ctx, GSASL_PASSWORD, "secret");
@end example

This may work for simple mechanisms, that need only a username and a
password.  But some mechanism requires more information, such as an
authorization identity, a special PIN or passcode, a realm, a
hostname, a service name, or an anonymous identifier.  Querying the
user for all that information, without knowing exactly which of it is
really needed will result in a poor user interface.  The user should
not have to input private information, if it isn't required.

The approach is a bad idea for another reason.  What if the server
aborts the authentication process?  Then your application has already
queried the user for a username and password.  It would be better if
you only asked the user for this information, annoying to input, when
it is known to be needed.

A better approach to this problem is to use a callback.  Then the
mechanism may query your application whenever it needs some
information, like the username and password.  It will only do this at
the precise step in the authentication when the information is
actually needed.  Further, if the user aborts, e.g., a password
prompt, the mechanism is directly informed of this (because it invoked
the callback), and could recover somehow.

Our final example (@pxref{Example 4}) specifies a callback function,
inside @code{main} as below.

@example
/* Set the callback handler for the library. */
gsasl_callback_set (ctx, callback);
@end example

The function itself is implemented as follows.

@example
int callback (Gsasl * ctx, Gsasl_session * sctx, Gsasl_property prop)
@{
  char buf[BUFSIZ] = "";
  int rc = GSASL_NO_CALLBACK;

  /* Get user info from user. */

  printf ("Callback invoked, for property %d.\n", prop);

  switch (prop)
    @{
    case GSASL_PASSCODE:
      printf ("Enter passcode:\n");
      fgets (buf, sizeof (buf) - 1, stdin);
      buf[strlen (buf) - 1] = '\0';

      gsasl_property_set (sctx, GSASL_PASSCODE, buf);
      rc = GSASL_OK;
      break;

    case GSASL_AUTHID:
      printf ("Enter username:\n");
      fgets (buf, sizeof (buf) - 1, stdin);
      buf[strlen (buf) - 1] = '\0';

      gsasl_property_set (sctx, GSASL_AUTHID, buf);
      rc = GSASL_OK;
      break;

    default:
      printf ("Unknown property!  Don't worry.\n");
      break;
    @}

  return rc;
@}
@end example

Again, it is bad style to use a fixed size buffer.  Mmm'kay.

Which properties you should handle is up to you.  If you don't know
how to respond to a certain property, simply return
@code{GSASL_NO_CALLBACK}.  The basic properties to support are
authentication identity (@code{GSASL_AUTHID}), authorization identity
(@code{GSASL_AUTHZID}), and password (@code{GSASL_PASSWORD}).  See
@xref{Properties}, for the list of all properties, and what your
callback should (ideally) do for them, and which properties each
mechanism require in order to work.

@node Properties
@chapter Properties

The library uses a concept called ``properties'' to request and pass
data between the application and the individual authentication
mechanisms.  The application can set property values using the
@code{gsasl_property_set} function.  If a mechanism needs a property
value the application has not yet provided, this is handled through a
callback.  The application provides a callback, using
@code{gsasl_callback_set}, which will be invoked with a property
parameter.  The callback should set the property before returning, or
fail.  For more information, see @xref{Callback Functions}.

There are two kind of properties.  The first, a ``data property'' is
the simplest to understand because it normally refers to short
strings.  For example, the property called @code{GSASL_AUTHID}
correspond to the username string, e.g., @code{simon}.

The latter properties, called ``logical properties'', are used by the
server to make a authentication decision, and is used as a way to get
the application callback invoked.  For example, the property
@code{GSASL_VALIDATE_SIMPLE} is used by the server-side part of
mechanisms like @code{PLAIN}.  The purpose is to ask the server
application to decide whether the user should be authenticated
successfully or not.  The callback typically look at other property
fields, such as @code{GSASL_AUTHID} and @code{GSASL_PASSWORD}, and
compare those values with external information (for example data
stored in a database or on a LDAP server) and then return OK or not.

@quotation Warning
Don't expect that all mechanisms invoke one of the logical properties
in the server mode.  For example, the CRAM-MD5 and SCRAM-SHA-1
mechanisms will use the data properties (i.e., username and password)
provided by the application to internally decide whether to
successfully authenticate the user.  User authorization decisions
needs to be made by the application outside of the SASL mechanism
negotiation.
@end quotation

The logical properties are currently only used by servers, but data
properties are used by both client and servers.  It makes sense to
think about the latter category as @samp{server properties} but the
reverse is not valid nor useful.

The semantics associated with a data property is different when it is
used in client context and in the server context.  For example, in the
client context, the application is expected to set the property
@code{GSASL_AUTHID} to signal to the mechanism the username to use,
but in the server context, the @code{GSASL_AUTHID} property is set by
the mechanism and can be used by the application (in the callback) to
find out what username the client provided.

Below is a list of all properties and an explanation for each.  First
is the list of data properties:

@itemize

@item @code{GSASL_AUTHID}

The authentication identity.

@item @code{GSASL_AUTHZID}

The authorization identity.

@item @code{GSASL_PASSWORD}

The password of the authentication identity.

@item @code{GSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN}

The anonymous token.  This is typically the email address of the user.

@item @code{GSASL_SERVICE}

The registered GSSAPI service name of the application service,
e.g. ``imap''.  While the names are registered for GSSAPI, other
mechanisms such as DIGEST-MD5 may also use this.

@item @code{GSASL_HOSTNAME}

Should be the local host name of the machine.

@item @code{GSASL_GSSAPI_DISPLAY_NAME}

Contain the GSSAPI ``display name'', set by the server GSSAPI
mechanism.  Typically you retrieve this property in your callback,
when invoked for @code{GSASL_VALIDATE_GSSAPI}.

@item @code{GSASL_REALM}

The name of the authentication domain.  This is used by several
mechanisms, including DIGEST-MD5, GSS-API, KERBEROS_V5 and NTLM.

@item @code{GSASL_PASSCODE}

The SecurID passcode.

@item @code{GSASL_PIN}

The SecurID personal identification number (PIN).

@item @code{GSASL_SUGGESTED_PIN}

A SecurID personal identification number (PIN) suggested by the server.

@item @code{GSASL_DIGEST_MD5_HASHED_PASSWORD}

For the DIGEST-MD5 mechanism, this is a hashed password.  It is used
in servers to avoid storing clear-text credentials.

@item @code{GSASL_QOPS}

The DIGEST-MD5 server query for this property to get the set of
quality of protection (QOP) values to advertise.  The property holds
strings with comma separated keywords denoting the set of qops to use,
for example @code{qop-auth, qop-int}.  Valid keywords are
@code{qop-auth}, @code{qop-int}, and @code{qop-conf}.

@item @code{GSASL_QOP}

The DIGEST-MD5 client query for this property to get the quality of
protection (QOP) values to request.  The property value is one of the
keywords for @code{GSASL_QOPS}.  The client must chose one of the QOP
values offered by the server (which may be inspected through the
@code{GSASL_QOPS} property).

@item @code{GSASL_SCRAM_SALTED_PASSWORD}

The SCRAM-SHA-1 client requests this property from the application,
and the value should be 40 character long hex-encoded string with the
user's hashed password.  Note that the value is different for the same
password for each value of the @code{GSASL_SCRAM_ITER} and
@code{GSASL_SCRAM_ITER} properties.  The property can be used to avoid
storing a clear-text credential in the client.  If the property is not
available, the client will ask for the @code{GSASL_PASSWORD} property
instead.

@item @code{GSASL_SCRAM_ITER}
@item @code{GSASL_SCRAM_ITER}

@cindex iteration count
@cindex salt
In the server, the application can set these properties to influence
the hash iteration count and hash salt to use when deriving the
password.  The default hash iteration count is 4096 and normally you
should not need to use a lower setting.  The salt should be a random
string.  In the client, the SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism set these properties
before asking for asking the application to provide a
@code{GSASL_SCRAM_SALTED_PASSWORD} value.

@item @code{GSASL_CB_TLS_UNIQUE}

@cindex channel binding
@cindex tls-unique
This property holds base64 encoded @code{tls-unique} channel binding
data.  As a hint, if you use GnuTLS, the API
@code{gnutls_session_channel_binding} can be used to extract channel
bindings for a session.

@end itemize

Next follows a list of data properties used to trigger the callback,
typically used in servers to validate client credentials:

@itemize

@item @code{GSASL_VALIDATE_SIMPLE}

You may retrieve GSASL_AUTHID, GSASL_AUTHZID and GSASL_PASSWORD and
use them to make an authentication and authorization decision.

@item @code{GSASL_VALIDATE_EXTERNAL}

Used by EXTERNAL mechanism on the server side to validate the client.
The GSASL_AUTHID will contain the authorization identity of the
client.

@item @code{GSASL_VALIDATE_ANONYMOUS}

Used by ANONYMOUS mechanism on the server side to validate the client.
The GSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN will contain token that identity the client.

@item @code{GSASL_VALIDATE_GSSAPI}

Used by the GSSAPI and GS2-KRB5 mechanisms on the server side, to
validate the client.  You may retrieve the authorization identity from
GSASL_AUTHZID and the GSS-API display name from
GSASL_GSSAPI_DISPLAY_NAME.

@item @code{GSASL_VALIDATE_SECURID}

Used by SECURID mechanism on the server side to validate client.  The
GSASL_AUTHID, GSASL_AUTHZID, GSASL_PASSCODE, and GSASL_PIN will be
set.  It can return GSASL_SECURID_SERVER_NEED_ADDITIONAL_PASSCODE to
ask the client to supply another passcode, and
GSASL_SECURID_SERVER_NEED_NEW_PIN to require the client to supply a
new PIN code.

@chapter Mechanisms

Different SASL mechanisms have different requirements on the
application using it.  To handle these differences the library can use
a callback function into your application in several different ways.
Some mechanisms, such as @samp{PLAIN}, are simple to explain and use.
The client callback queries the user for a username and password.  The
server callback hands the username and password into any local policy
deciding authentication system (such as @file{/etc/passwd} via PAM).

Mechanism such as @samp{CRAM-MD5} and @samp{SCRAM-SHA-1} uses hashed
passwords.  The client callback behaviour is the same as for PLAIN.
However, the server does not receive the plain text password over the
network but rather a hash of it.  Existing policy deciding systems
like PAM cannot handle this, so the server callback for these
mechanisms are more complicated.

Further, mechanisms like GSSAPI/GS2-KRB5 (Kerberos 5) assume a
specific authentication system.  In theory this means that the SASL
library would not need to interact with the application, but rather
call this specific authentication system directly.  However, some
callbacks are supported anyway, to modify the behaviour of how the
specific authentication system is used (i.e., to handle ``super-user''
login as some other user).

Some mechanisms, like @samp{EXTERNAL} and @samp{ANONYMOUS} are
entirely dependent on callbacks.

@node EXTERNAL
@section The EXTERNAL mechanism

The EXTERNAL mechanism is used to authenticate a user to a server
based on out-of-band authentication.  EXTERNAL is typically used over
TLS authenticated channels.  Note that in the server, you need to make
sure that TLS actually authenticated the client successfully.  It is
normally not sufficient to use TLS, since it also supports anonymous
modes.

In the client, this mechanism is always enabled, and it will send the
@code{GSASL_AUTHZID} property as the authorization name to the server,
if the property is set.  If the property is not set, the empty
authorization name is sent.  You need not implement a callback.

In the server, this mechanism will request the
@code{GSASL_VALIDATE_EXTERNAL} callback property to decide whether the
client is authenticated and authorized to log in.  Your callback can
retrieve the @code{GSASL_AUTHZID} property to inspect the requested
authorization name from the client.

@node ANONYMOUS
@section The ANONYMOUS mechanism

The ANONYMOUS mechanism is used to ``authenticate'' clients to
anonymous services; or rather, just indicate that the client wishes to
use the service anonymously.  The client sends a token, usually her
email address, which serve the purpose of some trace information
suitable for log files.  The token is not permitted to be empty.

In the client, this mechanism is always enabled, and will send the
@code{GSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN} property as the trace information to the
server.

In the server, this mechanism will invoke the
@code{GSASL_VALIDATE_ANONYMOUS} callback to decide whether the client
should be permitted to log in.  Your callback can retrieve the
@code{GSASL_ANONYMOUS_TOKEN} property to, for example, save it in a
log file.  The token is normally not used to decide whether the client
should be permitted to log in or not.

@node PLAIN
@section The PLAIN mechanism

The PLAIN mechanism uses username and password to authenticate users.
Two user names are relevant.  The first, the authentication identity,
indicates the credential holder, i.e., whom the provided password
belongs to.  The second, the authorization identity, is typically
empty, to indicate that the user requests to log on to the server as
herself.  However, if the authorization identity is not empty, the
server should decide whether the authenticated user may log on as the
authorization identity.  Normally, only ``super-user'' accounts such
as @samp{admin} or similar should be allowed this.

In the client, this mechanism is always enabled, and require the
@code{GSASL_AUTHID} and @code{GSASL_PASSWORD} properties.  If set,
@code{GSASL_AUTHZID} will also be used.

In the server, the mechanism is always enabled.  Two approaches to
authenticate and authorize the client are provided.

In the first approach, the server side of the mechanism will request
the @code{GSASL_VALIDATE_SIMPLE} callback property to decide whether
the client should be accepted or not.  The callback may inspect the
@code{GSASL_AUTHID}, @code{GSASL_AUTHID}, and @code{GSASL_PASSWORD}
properties.  These property values will be normalized.

If the first approach fails (because, e.g., your callback returns
@samp{GSASL_NO_CALLBACK} to signal that it does not implement
@code{GSASL_VALIDATE_SIMPLE}) the mechanism will continue to query the
application for a password, via the @code{GSASL_PASSWORD} property.
Your callback may use the @code{GSASL_AUTHID} and @code{GSASL_AUTHZID}
properties to select the proper password.  The password is then
normalized and compared to the client credential.

Which approach to use?  If your database stores hashed passwords, you
have no option, but must use the first approach.  If passwords in your
user database are stored in prepared (SASLprep) form, the
first approach will be faster.  If you do not have prepared passwords
available, you can use the second approach to make sure the password
is prepared properly before comparison.

@node LOGIN
@section The LOGIN mechanism

The LOGIN mechanism is a non-standard mechanism, and is similar to the
PLAIN mechanism except that LOGIN lacks the support for authorization
identities.  Always use PLAIN instead of LOGIN in new applications.

The callback behaviour is the same as for PLAIN, except that
@code{GSASL_AUTHZID} is neither used nor required, and that the server
does not normalize the password using SASLprep.

@xref{Use of SASLprep in LOGIN}, for a proposed clarification of the
interpretation of a hypothetical LOGIN specification.

@node CRAM-MD5
@section The CRAM-MD5 mechanism
@cindex CRAM-MD5

The CRAM-MD5 is a widely used, but officially deprecated (apparently
in favor of DIGEST-MD5), challenge-response mechanism that transfers
hashed passwords instead of clear text passwords.  For insecure
channels (e.g., when TLS is not used), it is safer than
PLAIN.  The CRAM-MD5 mechanism does not support authorization
identities; making the relationship between CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5
similar to the relationship between LOGIN and PLAIN.

The disadvantage with hashed passwords is that the server cannot use
normal authentication infrastructures such as PAM, because the server
must have access to the correct password in order to validate an
authentication attempt.

In the client, this mechanism is always enabled, and it requires the
@code{GSASL_AUTHID} and @code{GSASL_PASSWORD} properties.

In the server, the mechanism will require the @code{GSASL_PASSWORD}
callback property, which may use the @code{GSASL_AUTHID} property to
determine which users' password should be used.  The
@code{GSASL_AUTHID} will be in normalized form.  The server will then
normalize the returned password, and compare the client response with
the computed correct response, and accept the user accordingly.

@xref{Use of SASLprep in CRAM-MD5}, for a clarification on the
interpretation of the CRAM-MD5 specification that this implementation
rely on.

@node DIGEST-MD5
@section The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism
@cindex DIGEST-MD5

The DIGEST-MD5 mechanism is based on repeated hashing using MD5, which
after the MD5 break may be argued to be weaker than HMAC-MD5, but
supports more features.  For example, authorization identities and
data integrity and privacy protection are supported.  Like CRAM-MD5,
only a hashed password is transferred.  Consequently, DIGEST-MD5 needs
access to the correct password (although it may be hashed, another
improvement compared to CRAM-MD5) to verify the client response.
Alas, this makes it impossible to use, e.g., PAM on the
server side.

In the client, this mechanism is always enabled, and it requires the
@code{GSASL_AUTHID}, @code{GSASL_PASSWORD}, @code{GSASL_SERVICE}, and
@code{GSASL_HOSTNAME} properties.  If set, @code{GSASL_AUTHZID} and
@code{GSASL_REALM} will also be used.

In the server, the mechanism will first request the
@code{GSASL_DIGEST_MD5_HASHED_PASSWORD} callback property to get the
user's hashed password.  If the callback doesn't supply a hashed
password, the @code{GSASL_PASSWORD} callback property will be
requested.  Both callbacks may use the @code{GSASL_AUTHID},
@code{GSASL_AUTHZID} and @code{GSASL_REALM} properties to determine
which users' password should be used.  The server will then compare
the client response with a computed correct response, and accept the
user accordingly.

The server uses the @code{GSASL_QOPS} callback to get the set of
quality of protection values to use.  By default, it advertises
support for authentication (@code{qop-auth}) only.  You can use the
callback, for example, to make the server advertise support for
authentication with integrity layers.

The client uses the @code{GSASL_QOP} callback to get the quality of
protection value to request.  The client must choose one of the QOP
values offered by the server (which may be inspected through the
@code{GSASL_QOPS} property).  If the client does not return a value,
@code{qop-auth} is used by default.

@node SCRAM-SHA-1
@section The SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism
@cindex SCRAM

The SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism is designed to provide (almost) the same
capabilities as CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5 but use modern cryptographic
techniques such as HMAC-SHA-1 hashing and PKCS#5 PBKDF2 key
derivation.  SCRAM-SHA-1 supports authorization identities.  Like
CRAM-MD5 and DIGEST-MD5, only a hashed password is transferred.
Consequently, SCRAM-SHA-1 needs access to the correct password to
verify the client response.  Channel bindings are supported through
the SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS mechanism.

In the client, the non-PLUS mechanism is always enabled, and it
requires the @code{GSASL_AUTHID} property, and either
@code{GSASL_PASSWORD} or @code{GSASL_SCRAM_SALTED_PASSWORD}.  When the
@code{GSASL_CB_TLS_UNIQUE} property is available, the SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS
mechanism is also available and it will negotiate channel bindings
when the server also supports it.  If set, @code{GSASL_AUTHZID} will
be used by the client.  To be able to return the proper
@code{GSASL_SCRAM_SALTED_PASSWORD} value, the client needs to check
the @code{GSASL_SCRAM_ITER} and @code{GSASL_SCRAM_SALT} values which
are available when the @code{GSASL_SCRAM_SALTED_PASSWORD} property is
queried for.

In the server, the mechanism will require the @code{GSASL_PASSWORD}
callback property, which may use the @code{GSASL_AUTHID} property to
determine which users' password should be used.  The
@code{GSASL_AUTHID} will be in normalized form.  The server will then
normalize the returned password, and compare the client response with
the computed correct response, and accept the user accordingly.  The
server may also set the @code{GSASL_SCRAM_ITER} and
@code{GSASL_SCRAM_SALT} properties to influence the values to be used
by clients to derive a key from a password.  When the
@code{GSASL_CB_TLS_UNIQUE} property is set, the SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS
mechanism is supported and is used to negotiate channel bindings.

@cindex channel binding
The @code{GSASL_CB_TLS_UNIQUE} property signal that this side of the
authentication supports channel bindings.  Setting the property will
enable the SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS mechanism.  For clients, this also
instructs the SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism to tell servers that the client
believes the server does not support channel bindings if it is used
(remember that clients should otherwise have chosen the
SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS mechanism instead of the SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism).  For
servers, it means the SCRAM-SHA-1 mechanism will refuse to
authenticate against a client that signals that it believes the server
does not support channel bindings.

The SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS mechanism will never complete authentication
successfully if channel bindings are not confirmed.

@node NTLM
@section The NTLM mechanism
@cindex NTLM

The NTLM is a non-standard mechanism.  Do not use it in new
applications, and do not expect it to be secure.  Currently only the
client side is supported.

In the client, this mechanism is always enabled, and it requires the
@code{GSASL_AUTHID} and @code{GSASL_PASSWORD} properties.  It will set
the @samp{domain} field in the NTLM request to the value of
@code{GSASL_REALM}.  Some servers reportedly need non-empty but
arbitrary values in that field.

@node SECURID
@section The SECURID mechanism
@cindex SECURID

The SECURID mechanism uses authentication and authorization identity
together with a passcode from a hardware token to authenticate users.

In the client, this mechanism is always enabled, and it requires the
@code{GSASL_AUTHID} and @code{GSASL_PASSCODE} properties.  If set,
@code{GSASL_AUTHZID} will also be used.  If the server requests it,
the @code{GSASL_PIN} property is also required, and its callback may
inspect the @code{GSASL_SUGGESTED_PIN} property to discover a
server-provided PIN to use.

In the server, this mechanism will invoke the
@code{GSASL_VALIDATE_SECURID} callback.  The callback may inspect the
@code{GSASL_AUTHID}, @code{GSASL_AUTHZID}, and @code{GSASL_PASSCODE}
properties.  The callback can return
@code{GSASL_SECURID_SERVER_NEED_ADDITIONAL_PASSCODE} to ask for
another additional passcode from the client.  The callback can return
@code{GSASL_SECURID_SERVER_NEED_NEW_PIN} to ask for a new PIN code
from the client, in which case it may also set the
@code{GSASL_SUGGESTED_PIN} property to indicate a recommended new PIN.
If the callbacks is invoked again, after having returned
@code{GSASL_SECURID_SERVER_NEED_NEW_PIN}, it may also inspect the
@code{GSASL_PIN} property, in addition to the other properties, to
find out the client selected PIN code.

@node GSSAPI
@section The GSSAPI mechanism
@cindex GSSAPI

The GSSAPI mechanism allows you to authenticate using Kerberos V5.
The mechanism was originally designed to allow for any GSS-API
mechanism to be used, but problems with the protocol made it
unpractical and it is today restricted for use with Kerberos V5.  See
the GS2 mechanism (@pxref{GS2-KRB5}) for a general solution.

In the client, the mechanism is enabled only if the user has acquired
credentials (i.e., a ticket granting ticket), and it requires the
@code{GSASL_AUTHID}, @code{GSASL_SERVICE}, and @code{GSASL_HOSTNAME}
properties.

In the server, the mechanism requires the @code{GSASL_SERVICE} and
@code{GSASL_HOSTNAME} properties, and it will invoke the
@code{GSASL_VALIDATE_GSSAPI} callback property in order to validate
the user.  The callback may inspect the @code{GSASL_AUTHZID} and
@code{GSASL_GSSAPI_DISPLAY_NAME} properties to decide whether to
authorize the user.  Note that authentication is performed by the
GSS-API library.

XXX: explain more about quality of service, maximum buffer size, etc.

@node GS2-KRB5
@section The GS2-KRB5 mechanism
@cindex GS2
@cindex GS2-KRB5

GS2 is a protocol bridge between GSS-API and SASL, and allows every
GSS-API mechanism that supports mutual authentication and channel
bindings to be used as a SASL mechanism.  Currently we support the
GS2-KRB5 mechanism, for Kerberos V5 authentication, however our GS2
implementation is flexible enough to easily support other GSS-API
mechanism if any gains popularity.

In the client, the mechanism is enabled only if the user has acquired
credentials (i.e., a ticket granting ticket), and it requires the
@code{GSASL_AUTHID}, @code{GSASL_SERVICE}, and @code{GSASL_HOSTNAME}
properties.

In the server, the mechanism requires the @code{GSASL_SERVICE} and
@code{GSASL_HOSTNAME} properties, and it will invoke the
@code{GSASL_VALIDATE_GSSAPI} callback property in order to validate
the user.  The callback may inspect the @code{GSASL_AUTHZID} and
@code{GSASL_GSSAPI_DISPLAY_NAME} properties to decide whether to
authorize the user.  Note that authentication is performed by the
GSS-API library.

@cindex GS2-KRB5-PLUS
The GS2 framework supports a variant of each mechanism, called the
PLUS variant, which can also bind the authentication to a secure
channel through channel bindings.  Currently this is not supported by
GNU SASL.

@node KERBEROS_V5
@section The KERBEROS_V5 mechanism
@cindex KERBEROS_V5

The KERBEROS_V5 is an experimental mechanism, the protocol
specification is available on the GNU SASL homepage.  It can operate
in three modes, non-infrastructure mode, infrastructure mode and
proxied infrastructure mode.  Currently only non-infrastructure mode
is supported.

In the non-infrastructure mode, it works as a superset of most
features provided by PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5 and GSSAPI while at
the same time building on what is believed to be proven technology
(the RFC 1510 network security system).  In the non-infrastructure
mode, the client must specify (via callbacks) the name of the user,
and optionally the server name and realm.  The server must be able to
retrieve passwords given the name of the user.

In the infrastructure mode (proxied or otherwise), it allows clients
and servers to authenticate via SASL in an RFC 1510 environment, using
a trusted third party, a ``Key Distribution Central''.  In the normal
mode, clients acquire tickets out of band and then invokes a one
roundtrip AP-REQ and AP-REP exchange.  In the proxied mode, which can
be used by clients without IP addresses or without connectivity to the
KDC (e.g., when the KDC is IPv4 and the client is IPV6-only), the
client uses the server to proxy ticket requests and finishes with the
AP-REQ/AP-REP exchange.  In infrastructure mode (proxied or
otherwise), neither the client nor server need to implement any
callbacks (this will likely change later, to allow a server to
authorize users, similar to the GSSAPI callback).

The callback is used by mechanisms to retrieve information, such as

callback is used to decide whether a user is permitted to log in or
not.  You tell the library of your callback function by calling
@code{gsasl_callback_set}.

Since your callback may need access to data from other parts of your
application, there are hooks to store and retrieve application
specific pointers.  This avoids the use of global variables, which
wouldn't be thread safe.  You store a pointer to some information
(opaque from the point of view of the library) by calling
@code{gsasl_callback_hook_set} and can later retrieve this data in

Most functions in the GNU SASL Library return an error if they fail.
For this reason, the application should always catch the error
condition and take appropriate measures, for example by releasing the
resources and passing the error up to the caller, or by displaying a
descriptive message to the user and cancelling the operation.

Some error values do not indicate a system error or an error in the
operation, but the result of an operation that failed properly.

Errors are returned as @code{int} values.

@majorheading Name

GNU SASL (gsasl) -- Command line interface to libgsasl.

@majorheading Description

@code{gsasl} is the main program of GNU SASL.

This section only lists the commands and options available.

Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or
optional for any corresponding short options.

@majorheading Commands

@code{gsasl} recognizes these commands:

@verbatim
  -c, --client               Act as client (the default).
      --client-mechanisms    Write name of supported client mechanisms
                             separated by space to stdout.
  -s, --server               Act as server.
      --server-mechanisms    Write name of supported server mechanisms
                             separated by space to stdout.
@end verbatim

@majorheading Network Options

Normally the SASL negotiation is performed on the terminal, with
reading from stdin and writing to stdout.  It is also possible to
perform the negotiation with a server over a TCP network connection.

@verbatim
      --connect=HOSTNAME[:SERVICE]
                             Connect to TCP server and negotiate on stream

@majorheading Miscellaneous Options:

These parameters affect overall behaviour.

@verbatim
  -d, --application-data     After authentication, read data from stdin and run

@node Protocol Clarifications
@appendix Protocol Clarifications

This appendix contains clarifications to various SASL specification
that we felt were necessary to include, if for nothing else it may
serve as a guide for other implementers that worry about the same
issues.

@menu
* Use of SASLprep in CRAM-MD5::
* Use of SASLprep in LOGIN::
@end menu

@node Use of SASLprep in CRAM-MD5
@section Use of SASLprep in CRAM-MD5

The specification, as of @file{draft-ietf-sasl-crammd5-04.txt}, is
silent on whether a SASL server implementation applying SASLprep on a
password received from an external, non-SASL specific database (i.e.,
the passwords are not stored in SASLprep form in the database), should
set or clear the AllowUnassigned bit.  The motivation for the AU-bit
in StringPrep/SASLprep is for stored vs query strings.  It could be
argued that in this situation the server can treat the external
password either as a stored string (from a database) or as a query
(the server uses the string as a query into the fixed HMAC-MD5 hash).

The specification is also unclear on whether clients should set or
clear the AllowUnassigned flag.

In the server, GNU SASL applies SASLprep to the password with the
AllowUnassigned bit cleared.

@node Use of SASLprep in LOGIN
@section Use of SASLprep in LOGIN

The non-standard mechanism LOGIN presumably does not support
non-ASCII.  We suggest that the client should send unprepared UTF-8
and that the server apply SASLprep with the AllowUnassigned bit
cleared on the received username and password.

As GNU SASL is still under heavy development, some API functions have
been found to be less useful.  Those old API functions will be
supported during a transition period.  Refer to the NEWS file to find
out since when a function has been deprecated.

@var{outlen}:  on input the maximum size of the output array, on output

Type of callback function the application implements.  It should
populate the output array with some input from the user and set the
output array length, and return @code{GSASL_OK}, or fail with an error
code.

If OUT is NULL, the function should only populate the output length
field with the length, and return GSASL_OK.  This usage may be used by
the caller to allocate the proper buffer size.
